The following are approaches the GenIUSS group recommends:
1. Transgender/cisgender status via the “two-step” approach
When two demographic items can be added to an adult survey (or, in most instances, a standing measure
of sex replaced and a measure of current gender identity added), we recommend including measures of
self-reported assigned sex at birth and current gender identity. Testing shows that the “two step” approach
appears the most likely to have high sensitivity, as well as high specificity, with adults. It is unclear whether
assigned sex at birth should precede or follow current gender identity on population-based surveys; future
studies should investigate ordering effects.
    Recommended measures for the “two-step” approach:
    Assigned sex at birth
    What sex were you assigned at birth, on your original birth certificate?
    	Male
    	Female
    Current gender identity
    How do you describe yourself? (check one)
    	Male
    	Female
    	Transgender
    	       Do not identify as female, male, or transgender
    Promising measure for the “current gender identity” step in the “two step” ap-
    proach (recommended for further testing):
    Current gender identity
    What is your current gender identity? (Check all that apply)
    	Male
    	Female
    	Trans male/Trans man
    	Trans female/Trans woman
    	Genderqueer/Gender non-conforming
    	Different identity (please state): _______
                                                                                                                  v

executive summary
2. Transgender/cisgender status via the MA BRFSS 2013 single-item approach
When valid, self-report measures of assigned sex at birth and current gender identity are not on a survey
and cannot be added (or replace existing measures), then the following stand-alone demographic item is
recommended:
    Recommended measure for single-item transgender/cisgender status approach:
    Some people describe themselves as transgender when they experience a different gender identity
    from their sex at birth. For example, a person born into a male body, but who feels female or lives as
    a woman. Do you consider yourself to be transgender?
    	         Yes, transgender, male to female
    	         Yes, transgender, female to male
    	         Yes, transgender, gender non-conforming
    	No
    Note—Additional information for telephone interviewer if asked about definition of transgender:
    Some people describe themselves as transgender when they experience a different gender identity
    from their sex at birth. For example, a person born into a male body, but who feels female or lives as
    a woman would be transgender. Some transgender people change their physical appearance so that
    it matches their internal gender identity. Some transgender people take hormones and some have
    surgery. A transgender person may be of any sexual orientation – straight, gay, lesbian, or bisexual.
    Note—Additional information for interviewer if asked about definition of gender non-conforming:
    Some people think of themselves as gender non-conforming when they do not identify only as a
    man or only as a woman.
3. LGBT Identity
When valid, self-report measures of assigned sex at birth and current gender identity are not on a survey
and cannot be added (or replace existing measures) and a valid and separate measure of sexual orientation
identity is not already on a survey and cannot be added, then the following stand-alone demographic item is
recommended (without a write-in response option):
    Recommended measure for LGBT identity:
    Do you think of yourself as (please check all that apply):
    	Straight
    	         Gay or lesbian
    	Bisexual
    	Transgender, transsexual, or gender non-conforming
      IF yes to transgender, then probe:
    	Transgender or transsexual, male to female
    	Transgender or transsexual, female to male
    	         Gender non-conforming

                                                 glossary
Cisgender
“Cis” is the Latin prefix for “on the same side” (Schilt & Westbrook, 2009). Cisgender refers to individuals
whose gender identity matches their sex assigned at birth (Schilt & Westbrook, 2009; Green, 2006). , “Cisgen-
der” is a complementary concept to “transgender” and is used instead of “non-transgender” (Schilt & West-
brook, 2009). A person assigned male at birth who identifies as male is cisgender. A person assigned female
at birth who identifies as female is cisgender. This definition does not preclude the possibility that cisgender
people may be gender non-conforming.
Gender, gender identity, and gender expression
Gender is a multidimensional construct that has psychological, social, and behavioral dimensions that in-
clude gender identity and gender expression. Gender identity refers to a person’s internal sense of gender
(e.g., being a man, a woman, or genderqueer) and potential affiliation with a gender community (e.g., wom-
en, trans women, genderqueer). Gender expression is a behavioral dimension of gender, that is, how one
expresses one’s identity through appearance and behavior (Spence, 2011). Gender may be reported in terms
of a person’s felt, desired, or intended identity and expression, as well as how an individual believes that he
or she is perceived by others.
Gender minority
Gender minority is an “umbrella” term that refers to transgender and gender non-conforming people—peo-
ple whose current gender identity or gender expression do not conform to social expectations based on
their sex assigned at birth (i.e., natal sex) (IOM, 2011).
Gender non-conforming / genderqueer
The term gender non-conforming refers to individuals whose gender expression does not fully conform to
sex-linked social expectations (e.g., masculine girls/women, feminine boys/men). Gender non-conforming
people may identify with the term transgender, trans, transsexual or any number of related community-
created terms, or with an alternative, non binary identity (e.g., as genderqueer), or may have no self-concept
related to their gender expression.
Intersex / Differences of Sex Development
Intersex people are born with (or develop naturally in puberty) genitals, reproductive organs, and/or chro-
mosomal patterns that do not fit standard definitions of male or female (OII-USA, 2013). In the United States,
intersex infants and minors are often (but not always) diagnosed with a medically-determined intersex con-
dition or “Difference of Sex Development” (DSD) (Hughes et al., 2006). However, some people use the term
“intersex” as an identity label, sometimes even in the absence of such inborn physical characteristics.
Population-based data
Data collected using sampling procedures that allow for analyses and statistical inferences that can be
generalized to a population.
Purposive / convenience / community-based sample
Data collected using sampling procedures that are not designed to provide statistical inference that can be
generalized to a population. Purposive samples are often designed to study small or hard-to-reach/identify
populations and provide a more thorough understanding of the specific needs or concerns of
those populations.
                                                                                                           ix

GLOSSARY
Sex
The term sex refers to biological differences among male, female, and intersex people (hormones, second-
ary sex characteristics, reproductive anatomy) that can be altered over time through the use of hormones
and surgical interventions (Krieger, 2003). The assignment of individuals to a sex category by medical
practitioners at birth is typically based on the appearance of external genitalia. Assigned sex at birth is then
recorded on the birth certificate as male or female. The sex marker can sometimes be changed on legal doc-
uments (i.e., driver’s license, passport, birth certificate) through a complex set of legal procedures (Conron,
Landers, Reisner, & Sell, in press).
Transgender / Trans
Transgender describes individuals whose current gender identity is not fully congruent with their assigned
sex at birth (USDHHS, 2011; Feinberg, 1996). Some individuals who fit this definition may identify with the
term transgender while others, particularly some transsexual individuals, may not. Many use the shorthand
“trans” in place of “transgender.”
Transgender Men / Trans Men
These terms refer to persons who were assigned female at birth and identify as men, regardless of whether
they have physically transitioned from female to male.
Transgender Women / Trans Women
These terms refer to persons who were assigned male at birth and identify as women, regardless of whether
they have physically transitioned from male to female.
Transition
This term refers to a process (social and/or medical) where one undertakes living in a gender that differs
from the sex that one was assigned at birth. In a physical gender transition, individuals seek to alter their
primary and/or secondary sex characteristics through femininizing or masculinizing medical interventions
(hormones and/or surgery), typically accompanied by a permanent change in gender role (Coleman et al.,
2011). According to the current standards of care, transition is considered medically-necessary when clini-
cally indicated for an individual (Coleman et al., 2011).
Transsexual
A term used, often by medical providers, to describe individuals who seek to change or who have changed
their primary and/or secondary sex characteristics through femininizing or masculinizing medical interven-
tions (hormones and/or surgery), typically accompanied by a permanent change in gender role (Coleman et
al., 2011). The term transsexual is used by some individuals as an identity label.

   Why Data Collection on Population-based
   Surveys is Needed to Improve Transgender
   and Other Gender Minority People's Health
A Letter to Gender Minority Communities from the GenIUSS Group
We are people who know, from personal experience and academic research, that transgender and other
gender minority people face many challenges. We know from our own experience that discrimination and
prejudice hurt us. They hurt our health. They hurt our social well-being. They hurt our ability to be financially
secure. These problems affect us individually; they also affect our communities. For the well-being of our-
selves and our communities, we need many different kinds of statistics to understand these problems.
The U.S. government funds ongoing research to document the health and well-being of U.S. residents. This
research has not documented transgender and other gender minority people separately. As a result, it has
been difficult for us to document how many transgender and other gender minority people exist and how
discrimination and prejudice affect us. We urge U.S. government agencies that run this research to add ques-
tions that will help us learn more about these problems.
Transgender and other gender minority people and our allies already know about these problems. We have
done surveys within our communities; some of them are at the local and state level. Others, like the National
Transgender Discrimination Survey, are at the national level. These studies are important for showing what
we already know from our own experiences, but they are not the same as large, publicly-funded surveys.
Large, publicly-funded surveys help governments make decisions about where to invest public money.
Scholars often call these large, publicly-funded surveys “population-based surveys” because they try to study
a representative sample of the entire population. For example, a population-based survey of adults in the
U.S. might randomly select households from all around the country and invite a person in the household to
complete a survey -- perhaps in person or over the telephone. Population-based surveys tend to collect basic
information about the whole group of people they survey. This means that population-based surveys typi-
cally include general questions that apply to most people. They are not able to include questions about the
specific experiences of any one community, like transgender and other gender minority people.
Community-based surveys are different. They collect many details about the experiences and diversity of a
particular community. Community-based surveys give us important, detailed information about transgen-
der and other gender minority communities. Community-based surveys and population-based surveys have
different strengths and limitations. We need both kinds of surveys.
This report focuses on population-based surveys, not community-based surveys. In writing this report, we
recommend some questions for use in population-based surveys. This report will help transgender and
other gender minority people and our allies by helping make our needs visible to researchers and the people
who create government budgets. This report contains our best current recommendations for questions
about transgender and other gender minority people that can be added to large, publicly-funded surveys.

                                    A Letter to Gender Minority Communities from the GenIUSS Group
The survey questions recommended in this report are multiple-choice questions with limited answer options.
Population-based surveys have to use multiple-choice questions; fill-in-the-blank questions do not work for sur-
veys that include tens of thousands of people. We recognize that multiple-choice questions have significant limits.
They can’t capture the complexity of human identities and experiences in several important categories, especially
race/ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation, and gender identity or expression. Even so, it’s important to have the
best possible multiple-choice questions for population-based surveys.
One reason that population-based surveys use multiple-choice questions is that questions used to identify
minorities are phrased in ways that people in the majority group will understand. Cisgender (non-transgender)
people are in the majority. If a population-based survey asks a question that leads even a small percentage of cis-
gender people to answer surveys incorrectly (as if they were transgender or another gender minority), the survey
will miscount the number of transgender and other gender minority people. This result is called a “false positive,”
and survey questions that give lots of false positives cannot be used for surveys if we want the results to be accu-
rate and taken seriously by policymakers.
The questions we recommend are intended to be easy for cisgender people to answer accurately; they also allow
transgender and other gender minority people to make ourselves visible in population-based surveys. These
questions allow us to give answers that recognize differences between our assigned sex at birth and our current
gender identity or gender expression. They allow people who do not identify solely as men or women, or who
have another non-binary gender expression, to make that clear when responding to surveys.
Finally, we know that these questions will change over time, just as transgender and other gender minority
communities will. Over generations, survey questions about race and disability have also changed. We view this
report and our recommendations as one important step in making population-based surveys better. These ques-
tions will help make the needs of transgender and other gender minority people visible to policymakers who use
population-based surveys to make decisions. They will also help government officials who set budgets and fund-
ing priorities to understand the needs of transgender and other gender minority people and allocate resources
(e.g., time, money) appropriately.
These questions are a step towards making transgender and other gender minority people visible and countable
in nationwide surveys. Being countable—including our gender identity and gender expression—is an important
step for having the resources we need to live healthy, safe, financially stable lives.

Reisner and colleagues evaluated a “two-step” approach among a sample of young adults in their
mid-twenties to mid-thirties with the following items (Reisner et al., n.d.):
1. What sex were you assigned at birth, on your original birth certificate?
	Female

  In 2011, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention added both sex and gender identity data elements to the U.S. HIV/AIDS
surveillance system, including the Adult Case Report Form, as well as its electronic surveillance system -- the Enhanced HIV/AIDS Report-
ing System (eHARS). See Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Preven-
tion, Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention. HIV among Transgender People. August 2011, available from http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/transgender/
pdf/transgender.pdf. While a significant step towards improved data reporting, the inclusion of these data elements in the reporting
repository systems may not reflect the questions asked on primary data collection forms.

  Note Regarding “Intersex” as an Answer Option: “Intersex” is not included as an option for sex on birth certificate forms; therefore,
items asking assigned sex at birth should not include intersex as an answer option. It is unclear who would identify with an intersex
gender identity category since some intersex people/people with Differences of Sex Development (DSD) do not identify their gender in
this way and others who have no physical intersex condition or DSD do identify their gender in this way; therefore, researchers should
utilize measures that will clearly identify respondents from the population of interest. See Chapter 4 for a more thorough discussion of
these issues and suggestions for further research on measures to identify intersex people/people with DSDs in surveys.

Recommendations
1. Transgender/cisgender status via the “two-step” approach
When two demographic items can be added to an adult survey (or, in most instances, a standing measure
of sex replaced and a measure of current gender identity added), we recommend including measures of
self-reported assigned sex at birth and current gender identity. Testing shows that the “two step” approach
appears the most likely to have high sensitivity, as well as high specificity, with adults. It is unclear whether
assigned sex at birth should precede or follow current gender identity on population-based surveys; future
studies should investigate ordering effects.
    Recommended measures for the “two-step” approach:
    Assigned sex at birth
    What sex were you assigned at birth, on your original birth certificate?
    	Male
    	Female
    Current gender identity
    How do you describe yourself? (check one)
    	Male
    	Female
    	Transgender
    	       Do not identify as female, male, or transgender
    Promising measure for the “current gender identity” step in the “two step”
    approach (recommended for further testing):
    Current gender identity
    What is your current gender identity? (Check all that apply)
    	Male
    	Female
    	Trans male/Trans man
    	Trans female/Trans woman
    	Genderqueer/Gender non-conforming
    	Different identity (please state): _______
    	
                                                                                                               16

CHAPTER 2
2. Transgender/cisgender status via the MA BRFSS 2013 single-item approach
When valid, self-report measures of assigned sex at birth and current gender identity are not on a survey
and cannot be added (or replace existing measures), then the following stand-alone demographic item is
recommended:
    Recommended measure for single-item transgender/cisgender status approach:
    Some people describe themselves as transgender when they experience a different gender identity
    from their sex at birth. For example, a person born into a male body, but who feels female or lives as a
    woman. Do you consider yourself to be transgender?
    	         Yes, transgender, male to female
    	         Yes, transgender, female to male
    	         Yes, transgender, gender non-conforming
    	No
    Note—Additional information for telephone interviewer if asked about definition of transgender: Some
    people describe themselves as transgender when they experience a different gender identity from their
    sex at birth. For example, a person born into a male body, but who feels female or lives as a woman
    would be transgender. Some transgender people change their physical appearance so that it match-
    es their internal gender identity. Some transgender people take hormones and some have surgery. A
    transgender person may be of any sexual orientation – straight, gay, lesbian, or bisexual.
    Note—Additional information for interviewer if asked about definition of gender non-conforming: Some
    people think of themselves as gender non-conforming when they do not identify only as a man or only
    as a woman.
3. LGBT Identity
When valid, self-report measures of assigned sex at birth and current gender identity are not on a survey
and cannot be added (or replace existing measures) and a valid and separate measure of sexual orientation
identity is not already on a survey and cannot be added, then the following stand-alone demographic item is
recommended (without a write-in response option):
    Recommended measure for LGBT identity:
    Do you think of yourself as (please check all that apply):
    	Straight
    	         Gay or lesbian
    	Bisexual
    	Transgender, transsexual, or gender non-conforming
      If yes to transgender, then probe:
    	Transgender or transsexual, male to female
    	Transgender or transsexual, female to male
    	         Gender non-conforming

CHAPTER 4
Alternately, a definition could be provided, much in
the way the Massachusetts BRFSS measure provides
a definition of transgender (see Chapter 2), as in the
following measure:
Some people are assigned male or female at birth
but are born with sexual anatomy, reproductive
organs, and/or chromosome patterns that do not fit
the typical definition of male or female. This physical
condition is known as intersex. Are you intersex?
  	         Yes, an intersex man
  	         Yes, an intersex woman
  	         Yes, an intersex person, gender non-
	conforming
  	         No
These and other potential ways to identify intersex
people on population-based surveys need to be
further explored.7

  Analysis of Two Step Variables
  Several of the variable constructions iterated in this report require recoding in order to successfully
  analyze the variable. What follows is a schema showing the recoding categories indicated as a result of
  using a two-step variable such as the one below.
  Example of questions used to implement a two-step approach to assess transgender status:
  Step 1: What sex were you assigned at birth, on your original birth certificate?
  	Male
  	Female
  Step 2: How do you describe your gender identity?
  	Male
  	Female
  	Male-to-Female transgender (MTF)
  	         Female-to-Male transgender (FTM)
  	         Other gender identity (specify) ____________________’
  Gender identity refers to a person’s internal sense of themselves (how they feel inside) as being male,
  female, transgender, or another gender. This may be different or the same than a person’s assigned
  sex at birth.
