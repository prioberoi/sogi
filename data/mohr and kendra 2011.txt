   For each of the following questions, please mark the response that best indicates your current experience as an LGB person. Please be
as honest as possible: Indicate how you really feel now, not how you think you should feel. There is no need to think too much about any
one question. Answer each question according to your initial reaction and then move on to the next.
                                                                          Disagree  Disagree     Disagree       Agree       Agree   Agree Strongly

   For comparability to the norms published in this study, the item response instructions listed above should be included. Also, at some
point in the survey prior to these instructions, the following statement should be presented to respondents: “Some of you may prefer to
use labels other than ‘lesbian, gay, and bisexual’ to describe your sexual orientation (e.g., ‘queer,’ ‘dyke,’ ‘questioning’). We use the term
LGB in this survey as a convenience, and we ask for your understanding if the term does not completely capture your sexual identity.”
   In the interest of promoting further study, other researchers may use this scale without contacting us to obtain prior permission. However, we
do ask that researchers send any reports of research findings as soon as available, including those that remain unpublished, to Jonathan J. Mohr.
   Subscale scores are computed by reverse-scoring items as needed and averaging subscale item ratings. Subscale composition is as
follows (underlined items should be reverse-scored): Acceptance Concerns (5, 9, 16), Concealment Motivation (1, 4, 19), Identity
Uncertainty (3, 8, 14, 22), Internalized Homonegativity (2, 20, 27), Difficult Process (12, 17, 23), Identity Superiority (7, 10, 18), Identity
Affirmation (6, 13, 26), and Identity Centrality (11, 15, 21, 24, 25).
