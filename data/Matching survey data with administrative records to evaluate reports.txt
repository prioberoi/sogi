Matching survey data with administrative records to evaluate reports of same-sex married couple
households
This report is released to inform interested parties of ongoing research and to encourage discussion of
work in progress. The views expressed on statistical or methodological issues are those of the authors
and not necessarily those of the U.S. Census Bureau.
By Rose M. Kreider and Daphne A. Lofquist
Since they are a relatively small population among all households, same-sex couple households are
difficult to estimate accurately. In Census 2010, an issue affecting the measurement of same-sex couple
households was discovered. Mismarks on the sex question by opposite-sex married couples led to
inflated estimates of same-sex couple households, especially in the problematic nonresponse follow-up
form (NRFU) of the questionnaire (O’Connell and Feliz 2011). This working paper follows up on that
research and links American Community Survey (ACS) 2010 data and Census 2010 data with
administrative records in order to have a closer look at the accuracy of reported sex in survey data by
couple type.
This paper has four sections. In the first, we match ACS 2010 data with Social Security data (Census
Numident) 1 and look at consistency of reported sex by couple type. Next, we do the same for decennial
2010 data. In the third section, we look at whether assigning sex based on the reported first name
matches with the sex entry in the Census Numident. In the final section, we compare the characteristics
of couples who have mismarked sex with those who have not.
Research questions
This paper follows up on earlier research done with decennial 2010 data, which found error in estimates
of same-sex couple households (O’Connell and Feliz 2011). The earlier work used a first names index to
try to quantify the error and adjust the estimates. This paper checks survey reports against
administrative data in order to quantify the error and evaluate the use of the first names index to adjust
the estimates.
The research questions we evaluate here include:
           1. How often is there a mismatch between reported sex in Census survey data and the sex entry
on the Numident? Is the level of mismatch in ACS as high as in Census 2010?
           2. Can we isolate the source of error in the estimates of same-sex married couples?

  Census Numident is derived from the Social Security Numident and contains additional recodes. We will refer to
this file as the Numident in this paper.

         3. When sex is assigned based on a first name index, how accurate is it?
         4. Do the characteristics of same-sex married couples whose sex is not mismarked differ from
those of other couples?
The level of mismatch between reported sex and the sex entry in administrative data is important since
a low level of mismarks by opposite-sex married couple households can result in a significant inflation in
the estimates of same-sex couple households, especially those for same-sex married couples (O’Connell
and Feliz 2011). This is a statistical problem that arises because there are far more opposite-sex married
couples than same-sex married couples. The first group makes up an estimated 56 million households,
while the second is estimated at about 180,000 households in the 2012 ACS data (See Tables 1 and 2
online at: http://www.census.gov/hhes/samesex/files/ssex-tables-2012.xls). If just 1 percent of this
larger group mismarked the sex of one spouse, it would translate into 560,000 “same-sex” married
couples.
This type of problem is not unique to estimates of same-sex married couples; it would also occur for
estimates of other small populations. For example, suppose we were to estimate the number of
widowed people under age 30. According to ACS 2012 1-year data, there were some 49,000 widowed
men and women age 15 to 29. However, it is possible that if a small rate of the rest of the adult
population were to misreport their age or marital status inadvertently, this population might appear to
be larger than it really is. Suppose just 0.1 percent of widowed adults age 30 and over were to
mistakenly report their age to be under 30. This would result in roughly an additional 14,946 people
being added to the estimate of widows under age 30.
Data Sources
Census 2010
We use both unedited and edited variables from the decennial 2010 file. Census 2010 was discovered to
have error in estimates of same-sex married couples due to mismarks on sex by opposite-sex married
couples. This problem was especially pronounced in the nonresponse followup (NRFU) mode. For
details, see the report available online at: <http://www.census.gov/hhes/samesex/files/ss-report.doc>.
The decennial census was mainly self-response, with nonresponse followup conducted by field
representatives.
ACS 2010
We use both unedited and edited variables from the American Community Survey 2010 1-year file. The
2010 file includes the revised form layout implemented in 2008 which helps reduce, but does not
eliminate mismarks on sex as were present in the Census 2010 NRFU form. ACS is mainly self-response,
                                                                                                          2

with nonresponse follow-up conducted by field representatives. Note that the analyses conducted in
this report use unweighted ACS data. 2
Numident 2010
The Numident is an administrative data set which contains the value of sex recorded by the Social
Security administration. We match this data set to our survey data using a set of individual
characteristics, but are unable to match using Social Security Number. So there may be some false
matches, as well as some cases in the survey data that we are unable to match to the Numident file.
Mismatch between reported sex in ACS 2010 and the Numident
We use the unedited relationship and sex items in ACS data to identify people who report being in
same-sex and opposite-sex couple households. There were 1,999,996 people who were reported as a
householder, spouse or partner. Of these, 86,433 could not be matched to the Numident. So we were
able to match about 96 percent of the records overall. Since we consider couples during most of this
analysis, further description of the sample is in those terms. There were 999,084 unweighted couples 3 in
the 2010 ACS. Out of these couples, we drop 8,511 in which either the householder and/or the partner
is missing on the sex item in the ACS. Of the remaining 990,573 couples, we also drop 1,615 households
that report multiple spouses and/or partners. This leaves us with 988,958 unweighted coupled
households in the ACS. We then drop 65,566 couples because in the Numident either the spouse and/or
partner is missing on the sex item. We are left with 923,392 couples, about 92 percent of reported
coupled households with valid sex entries in the Numident for both partners, and in which both
members matched the Numident. Results presented in this study are not intended to represent the U.S.
population. 4
Table 1 and Figure 1 show unweighted numbers of coupled households in ACS by whether their sex
reports in the ACS match the Numident entries. Of the 923,392 coupled households, 843,202 reported
as married, and 80,190 reported as unmarried. Among those reporting as married couple households,
57.3 percent of those reporting as same-sex married couples are opposite-sex couples in the Numident.
This compared with 0.9 percent of those reporting as opposite-sex married couples, who are same-sex
couples in the Numident. For those reported as unmarried partner households, 7 percent of those who
reported as same-sex in ACS are opposite-sex in the Numident. The corresponding percentage of those
who differed for opposite-sex unmarried partner households is 1.6 percent. So, while mismatch rates
are generally low, the problem of opposite-sex married couples mismarking their sex and appearing to

evaluating reports of sex in ACS using administrative records data. For more information about matching between
ACS and the Numident, see Luque & Bhaskar 2014.

  At least one spouse or unmarried partner was reported in the household, and they matched to the Numident.
4
  Weights in the ACS are meant to produce representative estimates of the underlying population. However, it is
not clear whether they would produce representative estimates of the underlying population that matches to
administrative records. This is because the matching subset may be different from the ACS sample in a non-
random manner. It could also be argued that this non-randomness may be exacerbated for the subset who can be
matched.

report as a same-sex married couple has a large effect on the estimates of same-sex married couples in
ACS data.
Table 2 provides more details about the number of partners whose sex report in ACS does not match
their Numident record. Most often, either the householder or their partner’s report does not match.
However, in a very small percentage of cases, neither report matches the Numident record. If the error
is due to respondents mismarking sex, this means that they have misreported sex for both people.
Among opposite-sex couples, a higher percentage shows neither partner matching the Numident sex
value than those in which only one partner does not match. We need to consider this group separately
from couples in which one has apparently misreported their sex, in case those in which neither report
matches are a distinct group.
While the mismarking of sex on ACS by respondents or interviewers creates a problem in the estimates
of same-sex married couples, it is not the only source of error. It is difficult to believe that very many
respondents manage to mismark sex for both members of the couple. It is possible that these couples
reflect matches between ACS 2010 and the Numident that are false positives—they appear to match,
but perhaps are in error. To facilitate matching the ACS to the Numident, we do not have social security
numbers, which would provide the highest quality match. The match is done using other characteristics,
such as address, name, and age. So it is possible that sometimes the files appear to match, but we have
not successfully matched to the same person in the Numident. Since there are only two possible valid
values for sex in the Numident, we have only a 50/50 chance of the sex report matching between the
two files if the match is a false positive.
While Census Bureau staff in the Center for Administrative Records Research and Applications(CARRA)
have investigated the extent of false positive matches to federal administrative data and to commercial
data, we are not aware of any studies that have evaluated the false positive match rate to federal survey
data. 5 The rate of false positives is estimated to be less than 1 percent for federal administrative data,
but as high as 13 percent for commercial data (Layne, Wagner, Rothhaas 2013). False positive match
rates for federal survey data presumably fall somewhere between these two types of data. There are
likely to be more false positives than in administrative data, which may be verified for eligibility, but it is
also likely that the rate is not as high as for commercial data, since respondents are notified that their
participation is required by law.
It is also possible that some of these cases reflect errors in the Numident file. It is hard to imagine that
the rate at which sex is incorrectly recorded on the Numident is very high, though, since it is the value
from the Social Security record. In addition, a mismatch rate of 2 percent would still be quite low.
In previous research, O’Connell and Feliz (2011) showed that error rates differed by mode in 2010
decennial data. The layout of the sex question in the NRFU form was prone to mismarks. Table 3 shows

  By federal administrative data, we mean data collected as part of administering federal programs such as Social
Security, or birth/death records collected from states. Administrative data include everyone to whom the program
applies, and are often legal records. By federal survey data, we mean data collected by the federal government by
asking a sample of the public to respond either on a paper questionnaire, or by answering questions posed by an
interviewer in person or on the phone.

SEHSD Working Paper #: 2014-36
the breakdown of responses by mode in ACS, whether paper or computer assisted telephone (CATI) and
computer assisted personal interviews (CAPI). Mail response is self-response, where the respondent is
marking a paper form in order to indicate their answers. In mail response, 59 percent of those reported
as same-sex married couples in ACS show up as opposite-sex couples in the Numident. This compares
with 7 percent of those reported as same-sex unmarried couples whose sex reports do not match the
Numident (including couples where one or both do not match). Percentages of couples whose reports of
sex do not match Numident are much lower for opposite-sex couples, at 2 percent for married couples
and 3 percent for unmarried couples.
CATI/CAPI questionnaires are interviewer administered. In comparison with self-response modes, the
interviewer may serve as a knowledgeable interpreter of the questions for the respondent, and serve to
reduce errors. At the same time, interviewers are only human, and may also inadvertently mismark an
answer. In addition, there is an automated check that pops up in the CATI/CAPI when a same-sex
married couple is reported, which asks the interviewer to confirm. It does not ask the interviewer to
read the check to the respondent, however. Mismatch rates for CATI/CAPI responses were lower for
same-sex married couples than in the paper form, but higher than the paper form for other couple
types: 46 percent for same-sex married couples, 13 percent for same-sex unmarried couples, 4 percent
for opposite-sex married couples, and 4 percent for opposite-sex unmarried couples. The automated
check may help explain why mismatch rates were lower for same-sex married couples in CATI/CAPI than
in paper.
In summary, the mismatch between sex reports in ACS and sex entries in the Numident for same-sex
married couples is worse than we believed in ACS. Since the estimates from ACS are lower than
decennial 2010 estimates, this may mean that an even higher percentage than we previously estimated
based on the names index comparison may have been reported in error on Census 2010.
As mentioned previously, misreporting of sex on the ACS form by respondents is not the only source of
mismatch. The Numident is a high quality administrative data set, but it is not perfect. One indication of
this is the ‘gendif’ flag provided on the file. This flag indicates individuals whose sex value in the Social
Security file has switched over time. This could be due to an administrative error which the person has
had corrected, or because the person purposely worked to have their sex report changed to reflect a sex
transition. Table 4 shows individuals in the various couple groups and whether the householder and/or
their partner has had a sex switch in the Numident. Roughly 1 percent of the couples have at least one
member whose sex value has switched: 0.5 percent of unmarried same-sex couples (adding 0.2, 0.3 and
0.0 from Table 4); 1.2 percent of married same-sex couples; 1.0 percent of opposite-sex unmarried
couples; and 0.8 percent of opposite-sex married couples. This paper uses the most recent report of sex
on the individual’s record. Other research has found that as of 2010, roughly 1.45 million people born
between 1895 and 2010 had ever changed their sex value on their Social Security record. This would be
very roughly 0.5 percent of the US population in 2010, although it also includes children, and those in
the Social Security file for whom we do not have a date of death, but who had already died. 6 So while it

is a small percentage, it is another contributor to a mismatch between the ACS survey report and the sex
value on the Numident. Changes to sex in the Social Security file could also be the result of
administrative error.
Mismatch between reported sex in Census 2010 and the Numident
In this section, we turn to a comparison of sex reports in Census 2010 data with the Numident file.
Previous research (O’Connell and Feliz 2011) identified significant levels of sex misreporting in decennial
2010 data that affected estimates of same-sex couple households. By matching Census 2010 data to the
Numident, we hope to evaluate the extent of this misreporting, as well as evaluate the methods used to
produce the “preferred estimates” of same-sex couples, which were adjusted using sex probabilities
based on first name reports. We use the unedited relationship and sex items in Census 2010 data to
identify people who report being in same-sex and opposite-sex couple households. Similarly to ACS
2010, we were able to match about 95 percent of individual people who reported being a householder,
spouse, or partner in households with a spouse or partner to the Numident file. Looking at those
couples who matched the Numident, there were 63,107,488 couples 7 in Census 2010. Out of these
couples, we drop 832,426 in which either the householder and/or the partner is missing on the sex item
in Census 2010. Of the remaining 62,275,062 couples, we also drop 201,189 households that report
multiple partners and/or spouses. This left us with 62,073,873 coupled households in Census 2010. We
then drop 4,575,198 couples because in the Numident either the spouse and/or partner were missing
on the sex item. Finally we are left with 57,498,675 couples, about 91 percent of reported coupled
households with a sex value in the Numident for both partners who could be matched to the Numident.
Table 6 shows unweighted numbers of coupled households by whether their sex report in the decennial
matched the Numident. Overall, of the 306,587 households reported as same-sex married in 2010
decennial, 73 percent are opposite-sex in the Numident. In comparison, of households reported as
opposite-sex married in 2010 decennial, 0.56 percent were same-sex in the Numident. For those
reported as unmarried partner households, 7 percent of those who were same-sex in decennial were
opposite-sex in the Numident. The corresponding percentage of those who differed for opposite-sex
unmarried partner households was .79 percent. This very high rate of mismatch for same-sex married
couples mirrors the findings in previous work, although it is a bit higher (O’Connell, Feliz 2011). Note
also that the mismatch rate for same-sex couples is higher than found between ACS and the Numident
for same-sex married couples, but is substantively the same for same-sex unmarried couples, which are
a larger group.
Table 6 also details the number of partners whose sex report in 2010 decennial does not match their
Numident record. Of those couples whose report does not match the Numident, most often, either the
householder or their partner’s report does not match. As we saw when matching ACS and the
Numident, in a very small proportion of cases, neither report matches the Numident record. There are
multiple sources of error that might contribute to this, including a false match between decennial and

SEHSD Working Paper #: 2014-36
the Numident, and a mismatch between the sex recorded on the Numident record and the current
gender the person chooses to express. The proportion of couples where neither person’s sex matches to
the Numident is lower in decennial than in ACS. For unmarried couples, about 0.04 percent have neither
partner’s report matching in decennial and the Numident, while it is 0.03 percent for those who
reported as married couples, including opposite and same-sex couples.
Decennial 2010 data were collected mainly through self-response (paper form), with followup
conducted by interviewers using a different paper form, which contained a problematic vertical layout
of the answer categories for the sex question. The sex question on the NRFU form was prone to
mismarking. Unlike the CATI/CAPI followup in ACS, there was no check that alerted the interviewer to
verify households that reported same-sex married couples. For those reported as opposite-sex couples
in 2010 decennial, regardless of mode, mismatch rates between their decennial report and the
Numident are very low—1.0 percent or less (Table 7). This low rate was also regardless of whether the
couple reported as spouses or unmarried partners. Mismatch rates between decennial and the
Numident vary far more widely for those who were reported in decennial as same-sex couples. The
majority of same-sex married couples in 2010 decennial did not match their sex reports in the
Numident: 67 percent from the mail form, 87 percent from non-response follow-up (NRFU), and 53
percent of those from other types of response forms (for example: TQA (telephone question
instrument), Be Counted forms, Military Census Report, Shipboard Census Report). Mismatch rates for
unmarried same-sex couples were far lower, but still higher than for couples who reported as opposite-
sex in decennial 2010. While 4 percent of those reported as same-sex unmarried couples on the mail
form in 2010 decennial did not match their sex reports in the Numident, this was true for 26 percent of
these couples in NRFU, and 8 percent in other response forms.
While this analysis supports earlier work showing that sex misreporting by opposite-sex married couples
in the NRFU form was likely the significant factor in creating many of the households that appear to
have reported as same-sex married couples in 2010 decennial data (DeMaio, Bates & O’Connell 2013), it
also shows that the mail form did not function well. The vertical layout of the answer categories for the
sex question in the NRFU form was especially error prone, but mismarking was also a significant
problem in other modes.
As we saw in ACS, the idea that the couples whose sex reports do not match the Numident are not
matching due to changes to their sex is not supported. Table 8 shows the ‘gendif’ flag provided on the
Numident file, which indicates individuals whose sex value in the Social Security file has switched over
time. This could be due to an administrative error that was corrected, or because the person purposely
worked to have their sex report changed to reflect a sex transition, or because a new administrative
error was introduced. Roughly 1 percent of the couples have at least one member whose sex value was
switched: 0.9 percent of unmarried same-sex couples (adding 0.4, 0.5 and 0.0 on Table 8); 1.2 percent of
married same-sex couples; 1.1 percent of opposite-sex unmarried couples; and 0.9 percent of opposite-
sex married couples. These low rates of couples with someone whose sex report has switched over time
in the Numident are comparable to what we saw in the ACS-Numident match, and they do not explain
the relatively higher level of mismatches we see between sex reports in decennial 2010 data and the
Numident for same-sex couples, especially those who reported as householders and spouses.
                                                                                                          7

SEHSD Working Paper #: 2014-36
Mismatch between sex assigned based on first name index and the Numident
After discovering that the estimates of same-sex coupled households in Census 2010 data were likely
inflated by misreports of sex by opposite-sex couples, Census Bureau researchers used a first names
index in order to adjust the estimates. The adjusted estimates are referred to as the “preferred
estimates” in published materials and the methodology is described in detail in the O’Connell and Feliz
(2011) report. An index is created which tallies the number of times a particular name is reported as
male. If a name was reported as male 95 percent of the time, then the report of sex for that person was
set to male. The same was done for names reported as female. An “ambiguous” name means that the
sex could not be assigned based on the 95 percent rule. This included names that were male less than
95 percent, and more than 5 percent of the time, as well as names that were unique, or cases in which
the name field was blank. Using this methodology, the estimate of same-sex coupled households in
Census 2010 dropped from 901,997 to 646,464. In this section, we compare Census 2010 and the
Numident, but instead of comparing the unedited report of sex for those in coupled households as we
did above, we now compare their sex if it were assigned based on the first name index with the sex
entry in the Numident. This will allow us to evaluate the use of the first name index to adjust 2010
estimates. “Preferred estimates” were released that were adjusted based on the first name index. By
evaluating the names index against the Numident sex entries, we can evaluate whether this adjustment
method indeed compensated for the mismark errors.
Table 9 shows results for householders and partners or spouses. 8 For those in married and unmarried
couples, a very high percentage of those whose sex is assigned based on their first name matches the
sex entry in the Numident. Most of the match rates are at 97 or 99 percent. Among those who reported
as same-sex married couples, the rates are 98 percent for female names and 97 percent for male names.
Across all couple types, 12 to 15 percent had first names that could not be assigned based on the 95
percent rule, and so are labeled ambiguous. Those who report as same-sex married couples had a higher
percentage with ambiguous names (15 percent compared with 12-13 percent).
Tables 10 and 11 show name and sex match rates by mode, first for householders (Table 10) and then
for partners/spouses (Table 11). Results are similar for householders and spouses/partners, but we
show these as separate tables in order to illustrate this similarity. Match rates are close to 100 percent,
except for householders in same-sex married couple households in the ‘Other’ mode. This mode
includes a variety of miscellaneous types of forms, but constituted a small proportion of responses
overall. Even so, the match rate was high—at 87 to 89 percent. The same group had a slightly higher
proportion of first names that were ambiguous and the 95 percent rule could not be used to assign sex.
It is also possible that the first name was blank in some of these form types, since these forms were less
likely to be self-response.

In summary, using first name reports to assign sex, for the roughly 85 percent of those who have
reported a name that is 95 percent male or 95 percent female in the overall sample is highly effective.
This method of assigning sex matches the sex entry in the Numident in a very high percentage of cases—
often 96 percent or higher. Statistics Canada used a probabilistic names index method to assign sex for
those who reported as same-sex married couples in their 2006 Census
(http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2006/ref/rp-guides/families-familles-eng.cfm#DQ).
While first name reports are currently used in the ACS edit to assign sex when it is not reported at all,
they are not currently used to verify sex reports. However, verifying the reported sex of persons in a
same-sex married couple could address part of the error in the estimated number of same-sex married
couples.
In the final section of the paper, we take a look at the characteristics of those who misreport sex in the
ACS. Since decennial data have very few characteristics available, we turn back to ACS 2010 data in
order to explore the characteristics of couples who mismark sex. We compare characteristics of those
whose sex reports in ACS match their sex entries in the Numident file with those who do not. We want
to see whether there are notable differences among the groups. Do those whose sex reports in ACS do
not match their administrative records look like a different group than those who do?
Characteristics of those whose sex report matches the Numident compared with those who do not
We suspect that same-sex married couples whose sex reports do not match are really opposite-sex
couples who have inadvertently misreported. We want to understand how actual same-sex married
couples and opposite-sex married couples differ in order to then compare each group to reported same-
sex couples who do not match. The left portion of Table 12 shows householders and spouses in reported
same-sex married couples, and the right side shows those in reported opposite-sex married couples.
Couples whose sex reports in ACS match their sex report in the Numident for both partners “do match,”
while those where one or both partners have mismatching sex reports “do not match.” Compared with
opposite-sex married couple householders whose ACS sex reports match those in the Numident, same-
sex married couple householders who do match are younger, have smaller households, live in the
Midwest less often, are more often White, and less often foreign-born. They have higher average
household incomes, are more likely to have at least a bachelor’s degree, and when they do speak a
language other than English, they are more likely to speak English very well than those opposite-sex
married couple householders who do match.
In contrast, same-sex married couple householders whose sex reports in ACS do not match those in the
Numident differ markedly from same-sex married couple householders whose sex reports do match.
They are significantly older—householders whose sex reports do not match are 57 years old, on average,
compared with 46 years old for householders in same-sex married couples whose sex reports do match
their administrative records. They live in the Midwest in proportions that are not statistically different
from opposite-sex married couple householders whose sex reports do match, but are significantly
different from same-sex married couple householders whose sex reports match. Same-sex married

couple householders who do not match are more likely to be Black and Asian than same-sex married
couple householders who do match. They are more likely to be foreign-born than either opposite-sex
married couple householders who do match, or same-sex married couple householders. They are more
likely than either group to own their home free and clear, which is likely related to the fact that they are
older.
The remaining group, those who reported as opposite-sex married couple householders in ACS, but one
or both members of the couple do not match their sex report in the Numident, appear to have
characteristics that are distinct from the other groups. They are a little older than the same-sex married
couple householders whose sex reports match, but younger than the other two groups. They live in the
Midwest at rates that are statistically different from opposite-sex married couple householders whose
sex reports do match administrative records. Among the 4 groups of householders, they are least likely
to be White, and most likely to be Asian or Hispanic, and to be foreign born. A higher percentage of
them speak a non-English language at home, and they are less likely to speak English very well than
either group that matches their sex reports.
Looking further into these differences, we separated those couples where one does not match their sex
report from those couples where neither match their sex report in the Numident. Recall that for
opposite-sex couples who do not match their sex report in the Numident, the sex report did not match
for either person in more than half of these couples (see Table 2). So it does not appear that most of
these are actually same-sex married couples. However, there are still some 500,000 opposite-sex
married couples where the sex of one spouse does not match the Numident, and some of these are
potentially same-sex married couples. Looking at Table 12A, we see that opposite-sex married couples
where one does not match their sex report are closer in age to same-sex married couples whose sex
reports do match, but report having smaller households, on average, than opposite-sex married couples
who do match. They also have percentages with at least a bachelor’s degree that are lower than both
couple types who do match, and live in the Midwest at a rate that is more similar to opposite-sex
married couples than same-sex married couples. 9 They are less likely to be White than either group who
does match. For same-sex couple householders where one does not match, at least 14 percent are
foreign born, which does not differ statistically from opposite-sex couple householders who do match.
Opposite-sex couples where one does not match have household incomes that are lower than the other
groups.
As an additional check, we include a characteristic labeled “sex does not match name” (Table 13). This
estimate is generated using a variable that indicates what sex value would have been assigned in the
ACS edit if they had not reported sex. The value to be assigned is based on the probability that the
respondent’s first name is male. Not all names have a value on this variable, however. Overall, some 92
percent of the sample has a value on this variable. This includes sex assignment based on a proportional
assignment when the name is not at least 95 percent male or female. So, if a name is reported male 60
percent of the time, those who have this name would be assigned as male 60 percent of the time. We

compare whether the reported sex matches the sex value associated with the name in order to find out
how often those who reported as same-sex married couples have names that support that conclusion.
The “sex does not match name” category shows clearly that those who report as same-sex married
couples, but whose sex reports do not match the Numident are very likely to have a first name that does
not match their reported sex. This is much higher than for any of the other couple groups. This is
another confirmation that a high proportion of those who reported as same-sex married couples are
actually opposite-sex married couples who inadvertently mismarked the form. Even for the group of
roughly 500,000 couples who reported as opposite-sex married, but in which one member’s sex report
does not match, a relatively low percentage of those whose first name can be used to assign sex (about
3 percent) have names that do not match their sex report. It is possible that this group reflects a higher
percentage of people for whom the match between ACS and the Numident may be false. The rate of
false matches is not known. Comparing the listed characteristics of the two groups suggests that most of
these opposite-sex couples where one member does not match their sex report were not actually same-
sex married couples.
CONCLUSIONS
This paper further investigates the problem of inadvertent misreports of sex by opposite-sex couples
that lead to inflation of the estimates of same-sex couples. The estimation problem is especially
pronounced for same-sex married couples, since they are the smallest group, and because the
differential between the number of same-sex married and opposite-sex married couple households is
much larger than the differential between same-sex unmarried partner and opposite-sex unmarried
partner households. This is a statistical problem inherent in the estimates of any relatively small group.
A small error in the large group results in significant inflation of the estimates of the small group.
Presumably there is some small constant rate of error resulting in accidental mismarks for many
questions. These types of errors are only visible when looking at estimates of the smaller group. The
interrelationship between the sex and relationship items allows us to see this error.
We draw the following conclusions based on our work in this paper to quantify the error:
     1. While Census 2010 error rates for same-sex married couples are higher than for ACS, the error
         in ACS is still unacceptably high.
     2. There are multiple sources of error that make it difficult to establish a definitive estimate of
         same-sex married couples. These sources of error include: the mismarking of gender (and
         possibly relationship) in survey data, false matches between survey data and the administrative
         Social Security record, and inaccuracies in the Social Security record.
     3. Adjusting sex reports based on the probability that a first name is male is highly effective for
         those whose names are male or female at least 95 percent of the time.
                                                                                                         11

SEHSD Working Paper #: 2014-36
In ACS data, the very low rate of error among opposite-sex married couple households (2.5 percent, see
Table 2) results in large overestimates of same-sex married couple households, since the latter group is
so much smaller. Recall from Table 2 that a substantial portion of the opposite-sex couples in ACS who
do not match their sex entry do not match for either person (1.6 percent of all opposite-sex married
couples). So they still show up as opposite-sex couples in the edited data, and do not inflate the
estimates of same-sex married couples. The proportion in which neither spouse matches their sex entry
is higher in ACS than in decennial data. It is impossible to know whether this is because ACS respondents
actually mismark sex for both people more often, or because the match to administrative data may not
function quite as effectively for ACS as for decennial data. We have no indication that either possibility is
predominant.
Among those couples reported as same-sex married in ACS 2010 who we can match to the Numident,
some 58 percent appear to be opposite-sex married couples. Since we were not able to match all those
who reported as same-sex married couples in the unedited ACS 2010 data, and because there is likely
some level of false positive matches between ACS and the Numident, this may translate into a very
rough estimate of half of those reported as same-sex married couples actually being opposite-sex
married couples who inadvertently misreported on the sex item.
Using administrative records, this paper has confirmed the high level of error in the estimates of same-
sex married couples in Census 2010 data described by O’Connell and Feliz (2011). Although the level of
error in ACS is lower than in Census 2010, it is still substantial. We have also confirmed that the use of
first name reports to assign sex is highly effective for the roughly 85 percent of people who have a name
that is either reported as male 95 percent of the time, or female 95 percent of the time. In addition, we
have shown that those who mismark sex have distinct characteristics compared with those whose sex
entry on the administrative file confirms their sex report on ACS.
This investigation into the details of how misreports of sex by opposite-sex married couples affect the
estimates of same-sex married couples will inform ongoing research as we continue to work to improve
estimates of same-sex couple households, especially same-sex married couples. Since 2010, the Census
Bureau, as part of the OMB-led Interagency group on Measuring Relationships in Federal Household
Surveys, has worked to improve measurement of same-sex coupled households. A recently released
paper describes the group’s work. 10 DeMaio, Bates and O’Connell (2013) documents the Census
Bureau’s development of revised questions. Several quantitative tests of these questions were held in
2013 and 2014, with several more planned for 2015 and 2016.

 NOTE: To illustrate how to interpret this table, here is an example describing the bolded 53.2 percentage. Among householders in couples who
 reported as same-sex married in ACS 2010, and whose sex report in ACS did NOT match their Numident record, 53.2 percent had a first name
 which did NOT match their sex report.
