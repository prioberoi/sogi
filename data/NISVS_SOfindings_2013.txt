   During the first and second quarters of data collection, respondents were only asked about sexual orientation if they reported engaging in
  any same-sex sexual activity. This skip pattern was changed in the third and fourth quarters so that, regardless of sexual activity, all respondents
  were asked about sexual orientation. Analysis of data collected after the change in the skip pattern revealed minimal impact with respect to
  the misclassification of respondents in the first and second quarters. Among men who reported only having sex with women (n=3,440), 11 self-
  identified as bisexual, and 1 self-identified as gay. Among women who reported only having sex with men (n=4106), 14 self-identified as bisexual
  and none self-identified as lesbian. Additional information about response and cooperation rates and other methodological details of NISVS can be
  found in the technical note in Appendix B in The National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (NISVS): 2010 Summary Report (Black et al., 2011).

Sexual Violence Victimization

     How NISVS Measured Sexual Violence
     Five types of sexual violence were measured in NISVS. These include acts of rape (forced penetration), and types of sexual violence other than rape.
     •	 Rape is defined as any completed or attempted unwanted vaginal (for women), oral, or anal penetration through the use of physical force
        (such as being pinned or held down, or by the use of violence) or threats to physically harm, and includes times when the victim was drunk,
        high, drugged, or passed out and unable to consent. Rape is separated into three types, completed forced penetration, attempted forced
        penetration, and completed alcohol or drug facilitated penetration.
        -	 Among women, rape includes vaginal, oral, or anal penetration by a male using his penis. It also includes vaginal or anal penetration by a
           male or female using their fingers or an object.
        -	 Among men, rape includes oral or anal penetration by a male using his penis. It also includes anal penetration by a male or female using their
           fingers or an object.
     •	 Being made to penetrate someone else includes times when the victim was made to, or there was an attempt to make them, sexually
        penetrate someone without the victim’s consent because the victim was physically forced (such as being pinned or held down, or by the use
        of violence) or threatened with physical harm, or when the victim was drunk, high, drugged, or passed out and unable to consent.
        -	 Among women, this behavior reflects a female being made to orally penetrate another female’s vagina or anus.
        -	 Among men, being made to penetrate someone else could have occurred in multiple ways: being made to vaginally penetrate a female
           using one’s own penis; orally penetrating a female’s vagina or anus; anally penetrating a male or female; or being made to receive oral sex
           from a male or female. It also includes female perpetrators attempting to force male victims to penetrate them, though it did not happen.
     •	 Sexual coercion is defined as unwanted sexual penetration that occurs after a person is pressured in a nonphysical way. In NISVS, sexual
        coercion refers to unwanted vaginal, oral, or anal sex after being pressured in ways that included being worn down by someone who
        repeatedly asked for sex or showed they were unhappy; feeling pressured by being lied to, being told promises that were untrue, having
        someone threaten to end a relationship or spread rumors; and sexual pressure due to someone using their influence or authority.
     •	 Unwanted sexual contact is defined as unwanted sexual experiences involving touch but not sexual penetration, such as being kissed in a
        sexual way, or having sexual body parts fondled or grabbed.
     •	 Non-contact unwanted sexual experiences are those unwanted experiences that do not involve any touching or penetration, including
        someone exposing their sexual body parts, flashing, or masturbating in front of the victim, someone making a victim show his or her body
        parts, someone making a victim look at or participate in sexual photos or movies, or someone harassing the victim in a public place in a way
        that made the victim feel unsafe.

Stalking Victimization 

     How NISVS Measured Stalking
     Stalking victimization involves a pattern of harassing or threatening tactics used by a perpetrator that is both unwanted and causes fear or
     safety concerns in the victim. For the purposes of this report, a person was considered a stalking victim if they experienced multiple stalking
     tactics or a single stalking tactic multiple times by the same perpetrator and felt very fearful, or believed that they or someone close to them
     would be harmed or killed as a result of the perpetrator’s behavior.
     Stalking tactics measured:
     •	 Unwanted phone calls, voice or text messages, hang-ups
     •	 Unwanted emails, instant messages, messages through social media
     •	 Unwanted cards, letters, flowers, or presents
     •	 Watching or following from a distance, spying with a listening device, camera, or global positioning system (GPS)
     •	 Approaching or showing up in places, such as the victim’s home, workplace, or school, when it was unwanted
     •	 Leaving strange or potentially threatening items for the victim to find
     •	 Sneaking into victims’ home or car and doing things to scare the victim or let the victim know the perpetrator had been there

Violence by an Intimate Partner 

     How NISVS Measured Intimate Partner Violence
     Five types of intimate partner violence were measured in NISVS. These include sexual violence, stalking, physical violence, psychological
     aggression, and control of reproductive/sexual health.
     •	 Sexual violence includes rape, being made to penetrate someone else, sexual coercion, unwanted sexual contact, and non-contact
        unwanted sexual experiences.
     •	 Stalking victimization involves a pattern of harassing or threatening tactics used by a perpetrator that is both unwanted and causes fear or
        safety concerns in the victim.
     •	 Physical violence includes a range of behaviors from slapping, pushing, or shoving to severe acts such as being beaten, burned, or choked.
     •	 Psychological aggression includes expressive aggression (such as name calling, insulting, or humiliating an intimate partner), and
        coercive control, which includes behaviors that are intended to monitor and control or threaten an intimate partner.
     •	 Control of reproductive or sexual health focuses on interference with birth control. This includes the refusal by an intimate partner to use
        a condom. For a woman, it also includes times when a partner tried to get her pregnant when she did not want to become pregnant. For a man,
        it also includes times when a partner tried to get pregnant when the man did not want her to become pregnant.

         For those who reported being raped, it also includes having contracted a sexually transmitted disease or having become pregnant.

         IPV-related impact questions were assessed in relation to specific perpetrators, without regard to the time period in which they occurred,
         and asked in relation to any form of intimate partner violence experienced (sexual violence, physical violence, stalking, expressive
         aggression, coercive control, and reproductive control) in that relationship; 12-month prevalence of IPV-related impact was not assessed.

          By definition, all stalking incidents result in impact because the definition of stalking includes the impacts of fear and concern for safety.

     IPV-related impact questions were assessed in relation to specific perpetrators, without regard to the time period in which they occurred,
     and asked in relation to any form of intimate partner violence experienced (sexual violence, physical violence, stalking, expressive aggression,
     coercive control, and reproductive control) in that relationship; 12-month prevalence of IPV-related impact was not assessed.

     By definition, all stalking incidents result in impact because the definition of stalking includes the impacts of fear and concern for safety.

Impact of Intimate Partner Violence

     How NISVS Measured the Impact of Intimate Partner Violence
     For each perpetrator of intimate partner violence, respondents were asked about whether they had experienced:
     •	 Being fearful
     •	 Being concerned for safety
     •	 Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
        -	 Having nightmares
        -	 Trying hard not to think about it or avoiding being reminded of it
        -	 Feeling constantly on guard, watchful, or easily startled
        -	 Feeling numb or detached from others, activities, or surroundings
     •	 Being injured
     •	 Needing health care as a result of the intimate partner violence experienced
     •	 Needing housing services
     •	 Needing victim’s advocate services
     •	 Needing legal services
     •	 Contacting a crisis hotline
     •	 Missing days of work or school because of the intimate partner violence experienced
     •	 For those reporting rape by an intimate partner — contracting a sexually transmitted infection or becoming pregnant (for women)
     The questions were assessed in relation to specific perpetrators, without regard to the time period in which they occurred. Because violent acts
     often do not occur in isolation and are frequently experienced in the context of other violence committed by the same perpetrator, questions
     regarding the impact of the violence were asked in relation to all forms of violence (sexual violence, physical violence, stalking, expressive
     aggression, coercive control, and reproductive control) committed by the perpetrator in that relationship. Such information provides a better
     understanding of how individual and cumulative experiences of violence interact to result in harm to victims and provides a more nuanced
     understanding of the overall impact of violence.
