                      Purpose of review
                      This article describes methodological challenges, gaps, and opportunities in US transgender health
                      research.
                      Recent findings
                      Lack of large prospective observational studies and intervention trials, limited data on risks and benefits of
                      sex affirmation (e.g., hormones and surgical interventions), and inconsistent use of definitions across studies
                      hinder evidence-based care for transgender people. Systematic high-quality observational and intervention-
                      testing studies may be carried out using several approaches, including general population-based, health
                      systems-based, clinic-based, venue-based, and hybrid designs. Each of these approaches has its strength
                      and limitations; however, harmonization of research efforts is needed. Ongoing development of evidence-
                      based clinical recommendations will benefit from a series of observational and intervention studies aimed
                      at identification, recruitment, and follow-up of transgender people of different ages, from different racial,
                      ethnic, and socioeconomic backgrounds and with diverse gender identities.
                      Summary
                      Transgender health research faces challenges that include standardization of lexicon, agreed upon
                      population definitions, study design, sampling, measurement, outcome ascertainment, and sample size.
                      Application of existing and new methods is needed to fill existing gaps, increase the scientific rigor and
                      reach of transgender health research, and inform evidence-based prevention and care for this
                      underserved population.

  Table 1. Data need and research priorities
 Data need in transgender health research:
   Implementation of uniform collection of gender identity data, using the two-step method (Table 2). Uniform collection of sexual orientation
   and sexual behavior data will also allow improved resolution when defining cohorts
   Reliable and valid measures to examine health disparities by transgender status, and reliably assess exposures (e.g., gender affirmation
   and treatment) and health outcomes for transgender people
   Standardization of terminology to allow direct comparisons between studies
   Involvement of community and care provider stakeholders in every stage of research design, implementation and evaluation to provide
   appropriate context and insure that research methods are relevant, adaptable, and culturally appropriate
   Large sample size to enable well powered statistical analyses (statistical conclusion validity)
   Longitudinal prospective data to allow follow-up over time (opportunity for nested and ancillary studies)
   Representation of hard-to-reach subgroups and diverse transgender people in terms of age, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, gender
   identities (examine health disparities and identify mediators for future interventional studies)
 Methodological needs in transgender health research:
   Measures and data collection – identifying transgender people, standardized data collection in clinical settings (implement the two-step
   method), skip patterns for trans-specific data (anatomy inventory)
   Prospective longitudinal cohort – design engine (supports nested and ancillary studies)
   Interventional studies – Sequential, Multiple Assignment, Randomized Trials designs, cluster randomized clinical trials, implementation
   science (alternative models to individual-level randomized trials)
   Treatment outcomes – gender affirmation, hormones, surgical interventions, and health
   Fit methodology to study population – acceptability and ethnics of research with transgender people (observational vs experimental
   designs)

                                 About the Two-Step Method
                                 Standardization of data collection is critical for transgender health clinical practice and research.
                                 The two-step method is recommended, including by the World Professional Association for
                                 Transgender Health (WPATH). The two-step method asks questions about both assigned sex at
                                 birth and current gender identity. Cross-tabulating these questions allows for different sex and
                                 gender combinations to assess transgender health.

   A P0 of 0.5% corresponds to an approximate annual incidence of prostate cancer among natal men over 50 years of age or a 15-year risk of ovarian cancer in natal women over
40 years of age [52]. A P0 of just under 1% is an estimate of all-cause mortality in the United States [53], and a P0 of about 10% is prevalence of diabetes mellitus in US adults [54].

  An increasing proportion of transgender people have an identity and sexual orientation identity outside of historical binaries. The term ‘queer’ describes a range
of fluid and nonbinary gender and sexual identities and may be used in combination with the terms listed to describe particular subpopulations.
b
  Note: Transgender men and women may identify only as ‘male/female’ or as ‘transgender male/female.’ Androphilic and gynephilic are terms used to describe
sexual orientation identity. Androphilic describes sexual attraction to men or masculinity. Gynephilic describes sexual attraction to women or femininity. The terms
are used to identify a person’s attraction without attributing gender identity or sex assignment to the individual. Cisgender refers to being nontransgender. This
table refers to sexual orientation identity – additional questions regarding sexual behaviors and sexual organs involved in the sexual practices are recommended
in clinical settings.
