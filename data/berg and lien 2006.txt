    25  Survey-based research concerning sexual behaviour almost inevitably
    26  confronts the simultaneous problems of misreporting and non-response.
    27  These problems lead to disparities among estimates of the number and
    28  characteristics of those who engage in same-sex sexual behaviour. This
    29  paper proposes a statistical model to consistently estimate the frequency
    30  of same-sex sexual behaviour in the presence of non-ignorable misreport-
    31  ing and non-response. The model is ﬁtted using 1991–2000 General Social
    32  Survey data. Frequency estimates corrected for simultaneous misreporting
    33  and non-response are reported. According to the model, 7.1% of US
    34  males and 4.1% of females – 15.8 million individuals – are not exclusively
    35  heterosexual. Allowing for misreporting and non-response increases
    36  the estimated same-sex frequency by more than four million. The model
    37  reveals new patterns between misreporting and non-response probabilities
    38  and standard demographic variables such as age and income.

           It is possible to extend the sample backward in time to 1972. There are at least two reasons for restricting the sample period
    324  to 1991–2000, however. First, the income variable in the GSS is coded by income brackets and those brackets (both the
    325  thresholds and the number of categories) have changed periodically from 1972 through 2000. Inﬂation and changes in the real
    326  income distribution make it diﬃcult to link bracketed income data over long periods of time. Choosing a sample that begins
    327  in 1991 avoids all but one of the bracket changes, which ocurred between GSS coding schemes in 1996 and 1998. Income data
         are adjusted in the analysis by a simple linear transformation of the initial 21 categories onto the range of the lates
    328
         23 categories. Shifting attitudes toward homosexuality (Newport, 2001) provide a second rationale for sampling over
    329  relatively short time frames. Changes in the anticipated consequences and self-identiﬁcation habits of non-heterosexuals
    330  would result in unstable or time-dependent functions m, n and r.

         a
    351    Income is measured categorically on a 21-category scale in which the top bracket is US $75 000 and above, for 1991, 1993,
         1994 and 1996. In 1998 and 2000, income is measured on a 23-category scale in which the top bracket is US $110 000 and
    352
         above. Surveys were not conducted in 1992, 1995, 1997 and 1999. The categorical variable from the earlier years was
    353  transformed to the 23-category scale by assigning top bracket individuals from earlier years to the top bracket for later
    354  years, and by adjusting midpoints for inﬂation (using the CPI-U index), recording the adjusted values on a 23-point scale.
    355  The average male’s income (in the 13–15 range) corresponds to US $20 000–US $30 000 in 1998 dollars. The average female
    356  income (in the 11–12 range) corresponds to US $15 000–US $20,000.

           The variable Degrees is a count variable ranging from zero to four that indicates the number of degrees each respondent
    357
         has earned.
    358  c
           The variable City size is adjusted to cover the unit interval. City size in its unadjusted form ranges from 1000 to 7.3 million
    359  people. The overall average adjusted city size of 0.35 corresponds to a city population of 2.6 million. The average self-reported
    360  homosexual male’s city size of 0.85 corresponds to a city population 6.2 million. The median city size for all males
    361  is approximately 28 000, and 76 000 among self-reported gay males.

    385  city size. Thus, x max      k     and x max k    are equal to x with the kth component replaced by 1 or 0.
