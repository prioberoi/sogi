  Abstract
  Background: A barrier to monitoring the health of gender minority (transgender) populations is the lack of brief,
  validated tools with which to identify participants in surveillance systems.
  Methods: We used the Growing Up Today Study (GUTS), a prospective cohort study of U.S. young adults (mean
  age = 20.7 years in 2005), to assess the validity of self-report measures and implement a two-step method to
  measure gender minority status (step 1: assigned sex at birth, step 2: current gender identity). A mixed-methods
  study was conducted in 2013. Construct validity was evaluated in secondary data analysis of the 2010 wave (n = 7,831).
  Cognitive testing interviews of close-ended measures were conducted with a subsample of participants (n = 39).
  Results: Compared to cisgender (non-transgender) participants, transgender participants had higher levels of recalled
  childhood gender nonconformity age < 11 years and current socially assigned gender nonconformity and were more
  likely to have ever identified as not completely heterosexual (p < 0.001). No problems with item comprehension were
  found for cisgender or gender minority participants. Assigned sex at birth was interpreted as sex designated on a
  birth certificate; transgender was understood to be a difference between a person’s natal sex and gender
  identity. Participants were correctly classified as male, female, or transgender.
  Conclusions: The survey items performed well in this sample and are recommended for further evaluation in
  languages other than English and with diverse samples in terms of age, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status.

± The term “cisgender” is used to refer to non-transgender males and females. The prefix “cis-” in Latin means “on this side of”, opposed to trans or ultra, across,
beyond. Transgender is an umbrella term used to describe people whose sex assigned at birth is incongruent or different from their current gender identity
or expression.
