             Measuring Sexual Orientation and Gender

                 Abstract—Background. The Cancer Screening Project for Women is about the experiences of
                 legally unmarried women aged 40 to 75 years. Methods. Prior to the implementation of a survey of
                 experiences with breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screenings, we used cognitive-based in-
                 terviewing to evaluate questions for measuring sexual orientation and gender expression. Results.
                 We conducted interviews with 40 women, 19 who partner with women and 21 who partner with
                 men. Interviews highlighted respondent confusion, clarified the meaning of terms, and improved
                 the comprehension and utility of questions. Conclusions. Cognitive interview techniques can im-
                 prove the validity and reliability of data collected by cancer screening programs. J Cancer Educ.
