The Conceptualization and Measurement
of the Homosexual, Heterosexual, and Bisexual
Populations in the United States
Dudley L. Poston and Yu-Ting Chang
Introduction
In this chapter we use sexuality data from the 2006–2008 Survey of Family Growth
(NSFG) to conceptualize and measure sexuality and sexual orientation. We first
discuss the two main approaches used by social scientists to conceptualize sexual
orientation, namely, essentialism and social constructionism. Next we review some
of the prior empirical literature that has endeavored to measure sexual orientation.
We next specify three different dimensions of sexuality, namely, sexual behavior in
one’s lifetime, sexual self-identification, and sexual preference. We use the 2006–
2008 NSFG data to explore the multiple dimensions of sexuality, in contrast to
using only a single dimension, say, only behavior or only self-identification or only
desire. We examine the consistency in the dimensions for heterosexual persons,
homosexual persons, and bisexual persons. We show that an essentialist view works
in a fairly consistent manner for heterosexual persons but is not at all consistent
for homosexual and bisexual persons. This is so because heterosexuality is more
pervasive, with less room for differences. We then develop several percentages of
the U.S. adult population who according to various definitions may be classified as
heterosexual, homosexual, or bisexual. Finally we discuss some of the implications
of the findings of our research for demographic analyses of sexuality.
Conceptualizing Sexuality
Most of the social science literature on sexual orientation conceptualizes the phe-
nomenon using two basic perspectives or approaches, or a combination thereof.
These two views are known as essentialism and social constructionism (Lau-
mann et al. 1994, p. 284; Baumle et al. 2009, pp. 19–21). Founded in biology, the

essentialist view is one of dimorphism; it states that there is an “essential” biologi-
cal or psychological characteristic or attribute that is common to all persons and that
distinguishes them as either of one sexuality or not of that sexuality. This common
characteristic, or essence, is thought to be a fundamental drive or trait that estab-
lishes a person’s inclusion into, or not into, one of the sexual categories of hetero-
sexual, homosexual, or bisexual (Laumann et al. 1994, p. 285; Baumle et al. 2009,
pp. 19–20). The essentialist view states that a person is classified, or is not classi-
fied, as homosexual or as heterosexual or as bisexual; a binary distinction is made
between one who is in that category and one who is not. Thus, sexual orientation is
determined by the definition of the sexually distinct categories.
    The social constructionist view of homosexuality on the other hand counters
and critiques the essentialist perspective. Social constructionism argues against
the notion of binary categories, that is, that one either is or is not in a specific
sexual category (Foucault 1978; Butler 1990; Seidman 1996; Baumle et al. 2009,
pp. 20–21). Instead, this approach argues for a continuum with varying degrees of
the categories of sexuality. For example, social constructionists point out that the
degree of homosexual and bisexual prevalence and visibility tends to vary across
time and settings and that the concepts, definitions, and practices of homosexuality
and bisexuality are often not the same across context and cultures (Laumann et al.
1994, p. 285). To illustrate, what in one culture may be defined as “homosexual”
may not be so defined in another culture. For example, an individual may engage in
same-sex sexual behavior but not identify himself/herself as homosexual. Likewise,
one might identify as homosexual but never have experienced same-sex sex. Also,
the sexuality definitions and labels attached to individuals by other persons and by
the larger society may be incongruent with how individuals self-identify (Baumle
et al. 2009, pp. 19–21). Social constructionists would make similar statements with
regard to heterosexuality and bisexuality. Or as Hanne Blank (2012, p. xviii) writes
in her intriguing book about the history of heterosexuality, “despite the fact that
most of us use the term ‘heterosexual’ with enormous and cavalier certainty, there
seems to be no aspect of ‘heterosexual’ for which a truly iron-clad definition has
been established.” And the same may be stated about “homosexual” and “bisexual.”
    Until the sexuality research conducted in the 1940s and 1950s by Alfred Kinsey
and his colleagues (Kinsey et al. 1948; Kinsey et al. 1953), most sexuality research-
ers used an essentialist orientation. It was Kinsey who moved sexuality research
away from a position of essentialism. He argued that the sexuality of humans is
a lot more varied than was originally thought. The range of expression he created
has become known as the “Kinsey scale,” which is a 7-point scale that ranks over-
all sexuality from completely heterosexual (scored 0) to completely homosexual
(scored 6) and everything in-between. When he introduced his 7-point scale, he
wrote the following:
    Males do not represent two discrete populations, heterosexual and homosexual. The world
    is not to be divided into sheep and goats. It is a fundamental of taxonomy that nature rarely
    deals with discrete categories… The living world is a continuum in each and every one of
    its aspects … While emphasizing the continuity of the gradations between exclusively het-
    erosexual and exclusively homosexual histories, it has seemed desirable to develop some

22 The Conceptualization and Measurement of the Homosexual, Heterosexual, …                  361
    sort of classification which could be based on the relative amounts of heterosexual and
    homosexual experience or response in each history… An individual may be assigned a
    position on this scale, for each period in his life… A seven-point scale comes nearer to
    showing the many gradations that actually exist (Kinsey et al. 1948, pp. 639, 656).
In demographic and social science research on sexuality, the manner in which sexu-
ality and sexual orientation is conceptualized tends to vary. This is largely due to the
different ways sexual orientation has been defined in surveys and conceptualized by
the researchers (Saewyc et al. 2004). Sexuality may be defined in terms of sexual
behavior, sexual desire (including fantasy), and self-identification (Laumann et al.
1994; Saewyc et al. 2004). In analyses based on data from national surveys, social
scientists have used one or more of the above concepts of sexuality but particularly
those based on self-identification and behavior.
    For instance, analyses of homosexuality using data from the General Social
Survey (GSS) usually employ a behavioral definition of homosexuality, such as
whether a person’s sex partners within a particular timeframe (such as over the past
12 months, or the past 5 years, or in one’s lifetime) have or have not been entirely
or predominantly of the same sex as the respondent (Badgett 1995; Berg and Lien
2002; Black et al. 2003). The GSS does not include a question on the self-identifi-
cation of the respondent’s sexual orientation.
    Researchers using data from other surveys sometimes use questions tapping dif-
ferent definitions or dimensions of homosexuality. For instance, the NSFG includes
questions dealing with sexual behavior, sexual orientation, and sexual desire; these
are the survey data we use in this chapter. Another source is the National Health and
Social Life Survey (NHSLS) conducted by Laumann and his associates in 1992 (see
The Social Organization of Sexuality: Sexual Practices in the United States [1994]).
Because these surveys allow researchers to define sexuality in various ways, it is
possible for their analyses to be more closely attuned to a social constructionist,
rather than to an essentialist, view of sexuality in general and homosexuality in
particular (Baumle et al. 2009, p. 20).
    In contrast, when demographers and other social scientists use census data to
analyze sexuality, they almost always take an essentialist view owing to the type
of data available. Employing the so-called “unmarried partner” census data, for
instance, involves, by definition, a clear-cut and straightforward definition of a part-
nered same-sex individual, a partnered opposite-sex person, and a married person.
    Overall, a review of the literature about the conceptualization of sexuality shows
some basic methodological critiques, namely, the lack of common and consistent
definitions across the various surveys, samples not sufficiently representative of the
subpopulations under investigation, and a reliance on only one or two sexuality-
related questions. These issues may well be associated with social stigma attached
to sexualities other than heterosexuality, thus affecting not only the way the ques-
tionnaires are designed, but also the ways in which the respondents answer the
questions. For example, a person may be reluctant to identify as a homosexual or as
a bisexual and/or to report homosexual or bisexual behavior (Laumann et al. 1994,
p. 284; Baumle et al. 2009, p. 21).

    No doubt there are problems with data on sexuality no matter how the phenom-
enon is conceptualized and quantified. There are likely methodological limitations
and problems inherent in gathering and analyzing any data about sexuality, particu-
larly the sexually stigmatized minorities. Nonetheless, we find that the survey data
from the National Survey of Family Growth are particularly useful for researchers
following a social constructionist approach.
Empirical Analyses of Sexuality
In our opinion, perhaps the very best and most comprehensive analysis of sexual-
ity in the United States is The Social Organization of Sexuality: Sexual Practices
in the United States by Edward O. Laumann, John H. Gagnon, Robert T. Michael,
and Stuart Michaels, published in 1994. The authors began their chapter on “Ho-
mosexuality” with the following sentence: “Perhaps no other single number in this
study will attract greater public interest than our estimate of the prevalence of ho-
mosexuality” (Laumann et al. 1994, p. 283). They then reviewed some of the prior
research on this topic and addressed what they referred to as the “myth of 10 %,”
i.e., the belief that “there is a single prevalence rate of homosexuality and a single
estimate of 10 %,” and that both come from the same source, namely, the sexual-
ity research conducted by Alfred Kinsey and his associates in the 1940s and 1950
(Kinsey et al. 1948; Kinsey et al. 1953).
    In their research, Laumann et al. (1994) showed that there is not a single preva-
lence rate of homosexuality, and, moreover, that the 10 % figure did not come from
the work of Kinsey and his colleagues. The prevalence of homosexuality depends
on the way that homosexuality is defined. If one defines as homosexual a person
who self-identifies as homosexual, Laumann and his associates (1994) showed that
the percentage of persons who are homosexual is about 1.4 % for women and 2.8 %
for men. If the definition of homosexuality depends on same-sex desire and attrac-
tion, then they showed that the levels for males and females vary around 5 %. If one
uses same-sex behavior as the criterion, then the percentages for females range from
1.3 to 4.1 %, depending on how the behavior is defined, and from 2.7 to 4.1 % for
males. An important contribution of the research by Laumann and his colleagues is
that the prevalence of homosexuality, and also of heterosexuality and of bisexual-
ity by implication, varies according to the dimension of sexuality employed by the
researcher. If one chooses to focus on self-identification, then the prevalence of
homosexuality (and heterosexuality and bisexuality) in the population will likely
differ from the prevalence level obtained were one to use behavior or desire as the
principal criterion.
    In a more recent analysis, Gates (2011) combined five population-based surveys
containing data on sexuality that were conducted between 2004 and 2009. He es-
timated that on average for the adult populations enumerated in the surveys, 3.4 %
of females and 3.6 % of males in the United States identified themselves as les-
bian, gay, or bisexual. More interestingly, within the several surveys, he found that

22 The Conceptualization and Measurement of the Homosexual, Heterosexual, …            363
women were more likely than men to identify as bisexual, with more than half of
the men who engage in gay and/or bisexual sex identifying themselves as gay men.
    Self-identification, however, as we have shown above, is not the only criteri-
on used for measuring sexual orientation. Different dimensions for approaching
sexual orientation often result in different estimates of homosexual and bisexual
prevalence. Considering the dimensions of same-sex attraction and behavior, Gates
(2011, p. 5) reported that “adults are two to three times more likely to say that they
are attracted to individuals of the same sex or have had same-sex sexual experiences
than they are to self-identify” as lesbian, gay, or bisexual. He showed that over 8 %
of adults stated that they have ever engaged in same-sex sexual behaviors and about
11 % have at least some same-sex sexual attraction.
    In a much older study, Fay et al. (1989) used data from a national survey con-
ducted in the late 1970s to estimate that about one of five American men had ever
had same-sex sexual contacts in their lifetimes. They also indicated that about half
of men who had ever had same-sex sexual contacts were currently or previously
married. Smith (1991) used data from an adult household sample surveyed in 1989
to show that there were no sex differences in same-sex behavior prevalence; also
he reported that 5.6 % of American adults had been bisexual and only 0.7 % were
exclusively homosexual. Analyses of more recent data by Chandra et al. (2011)
showed that twice as many women than men reported having any same-sex sex
behavior in their lifetimes.
    In all the above analyses, a common finding seems to be the fluidity of sexual
orientation. All the analyses show that the estimated prevalence rates of homosex-
uality, heterosexuality, and bisexuality vary, often considerably, according to the
particular dimension of sexuality (behavior, attraction/desire, or self-identification)
used. We find similar results in our analyses of the 2006–2008 NSFG data. Accord-
ingly, in this chapter we examine sexuality from a social constructionist perspec-
tive, using one or more of the three dimensions of sexuality. We hold that heterosex-
uality, homosexuality, and bisexuality are complex phenomena, without universal
definitions. By following a social constructionist approach and using data on all
three dimensions of sexuality, we hope to show empirically the multi-faceted nature
and the fluidity of sexuality.
    With respect to the three dimensions, strictly speaking, identification is a straight-
forward question and, thus, should be a simple matter to measure. Were persons to
self-identify themselves as homosexual or heterosexual or bisexual, they would be
so identified in the research. But this does not necessarily mean that they would
respond in a similar manner to questions dealing with other dimensions of sexuality,
i.e., behavior or desire. Indeed a person could self-identify as homosexual, but state
that he or she has engaged in sexual activity with both males and females.
    Alternately, sexual desire or attraction is a variable that is not as straightfor-
ward as personal identification in the construction of a sexual category. Desire has
to do with individual feelings and wants regardless of behavior or identification.
If a respondent were to declare to desire sexual relations with someone of the
same sex, he or she would be defined as homosexual according to this dimension
of sexuality.

    Like desire, behavior is only one aspect of a constructed view of sexuality. For
instance, a person may engage in same-sex sexual behavior but not self-identify as
homosexual.
    The 2006–2008 NSFG includes questions enabling us to directly assess each of
the above dimensions of sexuality. We discuss next these issues in more detail.
The NSFG Data
The data in this chapter are from the 2006–2008 National Survey of Family Growth
(NSFG). The data were generated from 7,356 interviews with women and 6,139
interviews with men; the respondents were 15–44 years of age, and the interviews
were conducted from about July 1, 2006, through December 2008. Also, in some
parts of our chapter, data are drawn from comparable samples of women and men
interviewed in the 2002 NSFG. The “interviewing and data processing for the
2006–2008 NSFG were conducted by the University of Michigan’s Institute for
Social Research, under a contract with the National Center for Health Statistics
(NCHS). In-person interviews were conducted by trained professional interviewers
in the homes of a national sample of households. Interviewers entered respondents’
answers directly into laptop computers. Interviews averaged about 80 min in length.
The interview was voluntary; participants were provided information about the sur-
vey before being asked for signed informed consent. The survey was reviewed and
approved by the NCHS and University of Michigan Institutional Review Boards.
The overall response rate was 75 %…. The sample is a nationally representative
multistage area probability sample drawn from 85 areas across the country” (Mosh-
er 2010, pp. 2–3).
    The 2006–2008 NSFG questions we used to obtain respondent data on the be-
havioral dimension of sexuality are two. For females, the two questions are:
 Counting all your male sexual partners, even those you had intercourse with only
    once, how many men have you had sexual intercourse with in your life?
 Thinking about your entire life, how many female sex partners have you had?
For males, the two questions are:
 How many different females have you ever had intercourse with? This includes
    any female you had intercourse with, even if it was only once or if you did not
    know her well.
 Thinking about your entire life, how many male sex partners have you had?
A respondent answering having only opposite-sex partners and no same-sex part-
ners is defined as heterosexual on the behavior dimension of sexuality. A respondent
answering having both opposite-sex partners and same-sex partners is defined as bi-
sexual, and a respondent answering having only same-sex partners and no opposite-
sex partners is defined as homosexual. It is important to note that this behavioral
measurement is limited to assessing behaviors in one’s lifetime.

22 The Conceptualization and Measurement of the Homosexual, Heterosexual, …            365
    With respect to the self-identification of sexual orientation, the 2006–2008
NSFG asked each respondent the following question:
 Do you think of yourself as heterosexual or straight; as homosexual, gay or les-
    bian; as bisexual; or as something else?
One’s sexuality status according to the self-identification dimension is based on the
person’s answer to the above question.
    With respect to sexual desire and attraction, the 2006–2008 NSFG asked males
the following question, and a similar question was asked of females:
 People are different in their sexual attraction to other people. Which best de-
    scribes your feelings? Are you…Only attracted to females; Mostly attracted to
    females; Equally attracted to females and males; Mostly attracted to males; Only
    attracted to males; Not sure.
We specified the sexuality of males on the desire dimension as follows. Males who
are only attracted or mostly attracted to females are heterosexual; males who are
only attracted or mostly attracted to males are homosexual; males who are equally
attracted to females and males are bisexual. We specified the sexuality of females
on the desire dimension in a similar way.
    In our chapter, we report estimates of the U.S. male and female population aged
15–44 who provide the “heterosexual response,” the “homosexual response,” and
the “bisexual response” to at least one of the above questions on behavior, self-iden-
tification, and desire. We also use a social constructionist approach and combine the
responses to the above three questions and provide estimates of the percentages of
persons who give one of the three “sexual responses” according to one or more of
the above three questions. We first examine empirically the dimensions of sexuality,
i.e., self-identification, behavior, and desire, with regard specifically to homosexu-
ality, heterosexuality, and bisexuality.
Our Empirical Analyses of Sexuality
The Empirical Interrelations of the Dimensions of Sexuality
We now examine empirically the intersection of the three dimensions of sexuality.
We use data from the 2006–2008 NSFG and combine the sexuality responses to the
above three NSFG questions into seven possible outcomes as follows: providing a
homosexual (or a heterosexual or a bisexual) response (1) only to identification, (2)
only to desire, (3) only to behavior, (4) to both identification and desire, (5) to both
identification and behavior, (6) to both desire and behavior, and (7) to identifica-
tion, desire, and behavior. Unweighted percentages for U.S. females and males aged
15–44 are shown in the Venn diagrams in Figs. 22.1, 22.2, 22.3, 22.4, 22.5, 22.6.
    Figure 22.1 refers to the intersection of the sexuality dimensions for heterosexuality
for females. The Venn diagram shows the degree of overlap among the conceptually

22 The Conceptualization and Measurement of the Homosexual, Heterosexual, …              369
distinct dimensions of sexuality applied to female heterosexuality. As Laumann et al.
(1994, p. 298) have written in a similar presentation, “these (Venn) diagrams make
use of overlapping circles to display all the logically possible intersections among
different categories (of sexuality).” Whereas the diagrams in this chapter show all
possible combinations, they do not scale the areas of each circle; instead the percent-
ages attached to each area are shown in the figures. Each circle represents a dimen-
sion of sexuality. We show in Fig. 22.1 how exactly the 6,878 women who reported
any heterosexual behavior, desire, or identity are actually distributed across the seven
mutually exclusive combinations of the three sexuality dimensions.
    The data and diagram in Fig. 22.1 indicate that 93.5 % of all the female respon-
dents in the 2006–2008 NSFG, that is, 6,878 women of the total NSFG sample of
7,356 women, gave a “heterosexual” response to at least one of the three questions
pertaining to sexual behavior, self-identification, and desire. Specifically, for purposes
of illustration, the part of the “Desire” circle in Fig. 22.1 that does not overlap with the
“Behavior” or “Identity” circles indicates that just under 1.5 % of the women giving a
heterosexual response to any one or more of the three questions reported a desire for
persons of the opposite sex, but did not identify themselves as heterosexual and did
not report having only heterosexual sex in their lifetimes. However, nearly 75 % of the
women giving a heterosexual response to at least one of the three questions gave a het-
erosexual response to all three questions (see the overlapping component of all three
circles in the center of the Venn diagram). That is, almost three-fourths of the females
reported self-identifying as heterosexual, having only opposite-sex sex behavior in
their lifetimes, and being only or mostly attracted to males.
    Fig. 22.2 shows corresponding data for male heterosexuality. Nearly 94 % of the
males in the 2006–2008 NSFG gave a heterosexuality response to at least one of the
three questions dealing with self-identification, behavior, and desire. Importantly,
over 82.5 % of those males giving a heterosexual response to at least one of the three
questions gave a heterosexual response to all three questions.
    For males and females, there is a tremendous amount of consistency with respect
to heterosexuality. Almost 75 % of females and over 82 % of males who indicate a
heterosexual response to at least one of the three sexuality questions gave a hetero-
sexual response to all three questions. As we will see when we turn next to analyses
of homosexuality and of bisexuality, there is not nearly as much agreement. Where-
as one could argue that an essentialist approach works fairly well for female and
male heterosexuality, we show below that it does not work well at all with regard to
homosexuality and bisexuality.
    Figures 22.3 and 22.4 show Venn diagrams and data for female (Fig. 22.3) and
male (Fig. 22.4) homosexuality. Unlike the situation with regard to female and male
heterosexuality (Figs. 22.1 and 22.2), the data tables in the two figures indicate that
very small percentages of females and males gave a homosexual response to at
least one of the three sexuality questions dealing with self-identification, behavior,
and desire. Just over 2.4 % of the females and almost 2.9 % of the males stated that
they only had had same-sex sex in their lifetimes, and/or that they desired or were
attracted to same-sex persons, and/or that they self-identified as homosexuals. Also,
unlike the situation with heterosexuals, the Venn diagrams show that only 17.6 %
(see the middle overlapping area in the diagram of Fig. 22.3) of the females giving

370                                                          D. L. Poston and Y.-T. Chang
a homosexual response to at least one of the three sexuality questions gave the
homosexual response to all three questions, and the corresponding percentage for
homosexual males is 28.7 % (Fig. 22.4). Whereas an essentialist approach works
well for male and female heterosexuals (there is overwhelming support for treat-
ing heterosexuals as binary, that is, 75 % of females and 83 % of males are hetero-
sexual on all three questions), the essentialist approach does not work well at all
for homosexuals. Much smaller percentages of homosexuals are consistent in their
homosexual categorization.
    We note that a companion analysis of homosexuality in China (Farris et al. 2013)
shows much lower levels of agreement and consistency among the Chinese respon-
dents. The Venn diagram data in the China analysis indicate that only 4 % of the
females giving a homosexual response to at least one of the three sexuality ques-
tions gave the homosexual response to all three questions; and the corresponding
percentage for males is 3 %.
    The data and diagrams for bisexuals are reported in Figs. 22.5 and 22.6, and
they are similar to those for homosexuals. First, the bisexual data show that almost
15 % of all the females in the NSFG, and 5 % of all the males in the NSFG, gave
a bisexual response to at least one of the three sexuality questions. Also, there is
very little consistency in the categorization of bisexuals. Only 12 % of the women
giving a bisexual response to at least one of the sexuality questions gave a bisexual
response to all three questions (Fig. 22.5); and the corresponding percentage for
males is even smaller, at 6 % (Fig. 22.6).
    If one subscribes to an essentialist view of homosexuality and bisexuality (that
is, persons either are or are not homosexuals or either are or are not bisexuals), we
show that according to the 2006–2008 NSFG data there are very small percentages
of males and females consistently categorized as homosexual or as bisexual. An
essentialist strategy clearly does not work well at all with regard to conceptualizing
and measuring homosexuality and bisexuality. Taking a social constructionist ap-
proach, on the other hand, permits a more flexible understanding of homosexuality
and bisexuality. For example, according to this approach, homosexuals can be de-
fined based solely on the behavioral dimension or on a combination of two or more
of the dimensions of sexuality.
    Our empirical analyses demonstrate the importance of a social constructionist
perspective in developing an understanding of sexuality. Although some individuals
provided the same sexual response (e.g., heterosexual or homosexual or bisexual)
on all three dimensions, most of the respondents gave one sexual response (e.g.,
homosexual) to the NSFG question on one dimension and another sexual response
(e.g., bisexual or heterosexual) to the NSFG question on another dimension. Using
a social constructionist orientation in our analysis of sexuality provides us with a
much more encompassing understanding of sexuality.
Prevalence Rates of Sexuality
Having examined the interrelations of the dimensions of sexuality for males and
females with respect to heterosexuality, homosexuality, and bisexuality, we turn

22 The Conceptualization and Measurement of the Homosexual, Heterosexual, …         371
now to a presentation of estimates of the percentages of persons who give one of
the three “sexual responses” according to one or more of the above three questions.
We are endeavoring here to answer the question, what are the percentages of the
U.S. population aged 15–44 who are heterosexual, who are homosexual, and who
are bisexual.
    We first need to attend to an important methodological issue. We noted earlier
that the 2006–2008 NSFG consists of data for 7,356 women and 6,139 men, aged
15–44, in households in the United States. Mosher (2010, p. 33) has written that
the 2006–2008 NSFG sample “is a nationally representative multistage area prob-
ability sample drawn from 85 areas across the country…Persons were selected for
the NSFG in five major steps: Large areas (counties and cities) were chosen first.
Within each large area or “Primary Sampling Unit,” groups of adjacent blocks …
were chosen at random. Within segments, addresses were listed and some addresses
were selected at random. The selected addresses were visited in person … [If it was
determined that a person 15–44 lived at the address, then] … one person was chosen
at random for the interview and was offered a chance to participate.”
    Since the 2006–2008 NSFG is based on multistage probability sampling, one
cannot use these data to make inferences to the larger population of U.S. adults from
which the sample was drawn without first taking into account the sampling design.
Otherwise, the data will be treated by the statistical software as based on a simple
random sample. This will tend “to understate the true extent of sampling error in the
data … [because] when observations are clustered [i.e., drawn from a few selected
sampling points as is the case with the 2006–2008 NSFG], for many variables the
within-cluster variance tends to be smaller than the variance across the population
as a whole. This in turn implies that the between-cluster variance, i.e., the variance
of the cluster means, which gives the standard error for clustered samples, is in-
flated relative to the variance of the same variable computed from a simple random
sample drawn from the same population. Reduced within-cluster variance, espe-
cially with respect to sociodemographic variables, is typical within the small areas
that make up … [a] stage of multistage probability samples: areas of a few blocks
tend to be more homogeneous with respect to education, age, race, and so on than
the population of the entire country. The result is that when we use statistical proce-
dures based on the assumption of simple random sampling, our computed standard
errors typically are too small. What we need to do is to take account not only of the
variance among individuals within a cluster, but of the variance between clusters”
(Treiman 2009, pp. 207–208).
    Thus in the empirical analyses reported this section of our paper, we use the
“svy” suite of statistical sample adjustment methods available in the Stata 12 sta-
tistical package (StataCorp 2011) that introduce survey adjustment estimators. We
are thus able to adjust our analyses according to the various population and strata
weights available in the 2006–2008 NSFG.
    We show in Tables 22.1, 22.2, and 22.3 weighted (adjusted) percentage esti-
mates for the period of 2006–2008 of the prevalence of female and male hetero-
sexuality (Table 22.1), bisexuality (Table 22.2), and homosexuality (Table 22.3);
we also show the 95 % confidence intervals for each estimate (reported in the tables

372                                                          D. L. Poston and Y.-T. Chang
as “margin of error”); also shown in the tables are adjusted percentage estimates for
2002 using data from the 2002 NSFG.
   In the very bottom row of the tables, we provide a weighted percentage of per-
sons selecting the respective sexuality response to any one or more of the questions
pertaining to identification, behavior, and desire/attraction. For instance, the figure
of 95.43 for 2008 in the female heterosexuality table (Table 22.1) means that in
2006–2008, 95.4 % of U.S. females aged 15–44 gave a heterosexual answer to at
least one of the three questions dealing with the three dimensions of sexuality; an
estimated 72 % of U.S. women gave the heterosexual response to all three ques-
tions. In 2002, the percentages were 96 and 78 %, respectively. For males, the cor-
responding percentages were 96 and 79 %, respectively, in the 2006–2008 period,
and 95 and 81 % in 2002.
   So what is the prevalence level of heterosexuality in the United States for females
and males in 2006–2008 and in 2002? There is no one answer because it depends
on how one defines heterosexuality. To repeat Blank’s (2012, p. xviii) statement
that we quoted earlier in this chapter, “despite the fact that most of us use the term
‘heterosexual’ with enormous and cavalier certainty, there seems to be no aspect of
‘heterosexual’ for which a truly iron-clad definition has been established.”
   So if we define a heterosexual as a person who identifies as a heterosexual, and
engages in sexual behavior exclusively as a heterosexual, and desires or is attracted
only to heterosexuals, then the answer for females is around 72 % and for males
79 %. But if we invoke a social constructionist approach and define a heterosexual
as a person who identifies as a heterosexual, and/or engages in sexual behavior ex-
clusively as a heterosexual, and/or desires or is attracted to heterosexuals, then the
percentages are 95 % for females and 96 % for males.
   In Table 22.2, we present similar information for female and male bisexuality.
What are the percentages of bisexuality in the United States in 2006–2008 for fe-
males and males aged 15–44? Again, it depends on how we define bisexuality. If
we hold that a bisexual self-identifies as a bisexual, and engages in sexual behavior
with both males and females, and is attracted to persons of both sexes, then the
answer for females is 1.5 % and for males 0.3 %, and the corresponding percentages
for 2002 are about the same. But if we do not insist on this all-inclusive defini-
tion, and allow a bisexual to either identify herself/himself as a bisexual, and/or to
engage in sex with both same sex and opposite sex persons, and/or to be attracted
to both males and females, then the percentages are 13 % for females and 5 % for
males, with similar percentages for 2002.
   Finally, we show in in Table 22.3 similar information for female and male ho-
mosexuality. What are the percentage levels of homosexuality in the United States
in 2006–2008 for female and males? Again, it depends on the definition. If we
hold that a homosexual is one who self-identifies as a homosexual, and engages in
sexual behavior only with persons of the same sex, and is attracted to persons of
the same sex, then the answer for females is 0.3 % and for males is 0.6 %, and the
corresponding percentages for 2002 are around the same. But if we do not insist on
such a comprehensive definition, and if we hence define a homosexual in a broader
way as one who identifies as a homosexual, and/or engages in sex only with same

wsex persons,wand/or desires or is attracted to persons of the same sex, that is, if
we use a social constructionist approach in our definition of a homosexual, then the
percentages are 1.9 % for females and 2.2 % for males, with roughly similar percent-
ages for 2002.
    Since we are subscribing to a social constructionist approach and not an essen-
tialist one, we will define each of the sexualities in a more inclusive manner. Thus
we would state that a homosexual is one who gives a homosexual response to any
one or more of the three questions dealing with the dimensions of sexuality, and we
would define heterosexuals and bisexuals in a similar way. Hence in the 2006–2008
period, we would estimate, based on the 2006–2008 NSFG data, that among female
adults (aged 15–44), 95 % are heterosexual, 13 % are bisexual, and 2 % are homo-
sexual. The corresponding percentages for males are 96, 5, and 2 %. It is important
to recognize that the percentages for females, and for males, sum to more than
100 % because of the fluid nature of our definitions. In the next section of this chap-
ter we explore some of the implications of our analyses.
Summary and Discussion
In this chapter we used data from the 2006–2008 National Survey of Family Growth
(NSFG) to conceptualize and measure various aspects of sexuality and sexual orien-
tation. We first discussed the two main approaches used by social scientists to con-
ceptualize sexual orientation, namely, essentialism and social constructionism and
then reviewed some of the empirical literature measuring sexual orientation. We
next specified three different dimensions of sexuality, namely, sexual behavior in
one’s lifetime, sexual self-identification, and sexual preference/attraction. We then
used the 2006–2008 NSFG data to first examine the degree of consistency in the
three dimensions for heterosexual persons, for homosexual persons, and for bisex-
ual persons. We showed that an essentialist view works fairly well for heterosexual
persons, but not at all for homosexuals and for bisexuals. We then calculated several
percentages of the U.S. adult population who according to the different definitions
would be classified as heterosexual, homosexual, and bisexual. We found that con-
clusions about the prevalence of homosexuality, heterosexuality, and bisexuality
in the U.S. adult population depend significantly on the way we define the three
sexualities.
    The percentages of heterosexuality, bisexuality, and homosexuality among U.S.
adults are at their highest when we use a broader definition. That is, if we follow a
social constructionist approach and define, for example, a homosexual as one who
gives a “homosexual” response to at least one of the three NSFG questions dealing
with the three dimensions of sexuality (self-identification, behavior, and attraction),
and if we define heterosexuals and if we define bisexuals in similar ways, then 95 %
of the U.S. female population is heterosexual, 13 % is bisexual, and 2 % is homosex-
ual; the corresponding figures for males are 96, 5, and 2 %. The percentages sum to
more than 100 % because we used a broad definition. On the other hand, if we insist

that a person’s sexuality must reflect a consistency across the three dimensions, that
is, for example, a homosexual must give the homosexual response to each of the
three survey questions on the sexuality dimensions, then the percentages are con-
siderably lower, at 72 and 79 % for female and male heterosexuals, 1.5 and 0.3 %
for female and male bisexuals, and 0.3 and 0.6 % for female and male homosexuals.
Empirical estimates of the prevalence among U.S. adults of the three sexualities
certainly depend on how sexualities are conceptualized.
    As Blank has written, “sexual expectations and behaviors, like all other social
expectations and behaviors, change over time … [if ] we speak … of interactions of
males and females, these relationships have simply not always been the same, nor
have the people participating in them been expected to do, think, feel, or experience
the same sorts of things” (2012, p. xvii). In our opinion it is much more realistic and
appropriate to view sexuality with a social constructionist eye.
    Certainly, an important implication of our research is the need to use a social
constructionist approach in analyses of sexuality instead of an essentialist approach.
Persons in one sexual category, say, homosexuals, may be distinguished from per-
sons in another sexual category, say, heterosexuals, in many different ways. Given
the limited empirical research on sexuality and sexual orientation and the lack of
agreement regarding the meaning of the sexualities, it would appear best to use as
broad a purview as possible. It would be a mistake, we believe, to use an essentialist
view that assumes that there is an essential biological or psychological character-
istic common to all persons in a sexual category that is distinct and separate from
persons in another sexual category. An essentialist approach is excessively narrow
and necessarily results in the identification of very small percentages of homosexu-
als and bisexuals.
    Our empirical results about the lack of a consistency with regard to the three
dimensions of sexuality, particularly for homosexuals and for bisexuals, replicate
earlier research focusing on homosexuals by Laumann and his colleagues (1994,
pp. 300–301). Their research pointed to the “high degree of variability in the way
that differing elements of homosexuality are distributed in the population. This vari-
ability relates to the way that homosexuality is both organized as a set of behaviors
and practices and experienced subjectively. It raised quite provocative questions
about the definition of homosexuality.”
    Overall, our findings indicate that future research should continue to refine the
understanding of what it means to be heterosexual, homosexual, and bisexual, and
how these meanings vary among populations and over time. There exists a real need
for broad-based scholarship on the existence of the various sexualities, their compo-
nents, and their defining characteristics.
    We end our chapter with a pithy observation from Blank in the first pages of her
book on heterosexuality. She writes the following: “every time I go to the doctor, I end
up questioning my sexual orientation … The clinic I visit (has a form that) includes
… little boxes, a small matter of demographic bookkeeping. Next to the boxes are the
options, ‘gay,’ ‘lesbian,’ ‘bisexual,’ ‘transgender,’ or ‘heterosexual.’ You’re supposed
to check one. You might not think this would pose a difficulty” (Blank 2012, p. ix). In
the balance of her very insightful book, she argues that indeed it is a difficulty; what
you are depends on the definitions and the approach followed.
