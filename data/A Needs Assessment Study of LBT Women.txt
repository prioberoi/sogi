           ABSTRACT: This study reports the results of an extensive needs assessment survey conducted
           under the auspices of the Lesbian Services Program (LSP) at Whitman-Walker Clinic with
           approximately 700 lesbian, bisexual, and transgendered (LBT) women in the greater metropolitan
           Washington DC area. The survey collected information to: (1) describe the population served by
           the LSP catchment area; and (2) learn about respondents’ health concerns and needs, care-seeking
           practices, perceptions of risk, and access to care. Respondents provided information about their:
           (1) self-identified sexual orientation (SO) and gender identity (GI); (2) significant physical and
           mental health concerns; (3) health care and disease prevention practices; and (4) SO/GI-related
           concerns including selection of health care providers, confidentiality and decision to “come out”
           to health care providers, and perceived effect of SO/GI on quality of health care. Preliminary
           results indicate that some respondents have significant concerns about the impact of their SO/GI
           on their health care. In addition, many respondents report they have failed to seek health care,
           partly in response to concerns about institutionalized homophobia from the health care
           community.
