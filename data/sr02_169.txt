* Estimates have a relative standard error greater than 30% and less than or equal to 50% and should be used with caution as they do not meet standards of reliability or precision.

† Estimates with a relative standard error greater than 50% are not shown.

1
 Selected health indicators were chosen based on survey questions that were comparable across both NHIS and NSFG. Definitions of selected health measures can be found in the Appendix.

2
 In NHIS, the response option provided is ‘‘lesbian or gay.’’ In NSFG, the response option provided is ‘‘homosexual, gay, or lesbian.’’

3
 In NHIS, the response option provided is ‘‘straight, that is, not lesbian or gay.’’ In NSFG, the response option provided is ‘‘heterosexual or straight.’’

4
 Percentages in this table are rounded.

5
 Only calculated for nonpregnant women aged 20–44.

6
 HMO is health maintenance organization.

7
 In NHIS, this category includes ‘‘hospital outpatient department,’’ ‘‘some other place,’’ and ‘‘doesn’t go to one place most often.’’ In NSFG, this category includes ‘‘hospital outpatient clinic,’’ ‘‘hospital

regular room,’’ ‘‘urgent care center, urgi-care, or walk-in facility,’’ or ‘‘some other place.’’

8
 Estimates from NSFG were generated using the imputed version of the variable for ‘‘ever been tested for HIV.’’

NOTES: NHIS is National Health Interview Survey; NSFG is National Survey of Family Growth.
