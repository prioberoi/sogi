 What is CHIS?
   A large, omnibus public health telephone survey of California
   Uses a geographically stratified, random digit dial (RDD)
    sample of landline and cell telephone numbers
   Includes 42,000 to 56,000 households per cycle
   Conducted every other year since 2001 and continuously
    beginning in 2011
   Interviews conducted in 6 languages: English, Spanish,
    Chinese (Cantonese and Mandarin), Korean, and Vietnamese
   Included sexual identity questions since 2001 and gender of
    sexual partner/s since 2003

 CHIS quex development—general
   Participatory process involving multiple stakeholders
     Advisory Board & Technical Advisory Committees (5)
     Work Groups (ad hoc, topic specific) & consultation with experts
   Use well-tested questions from established surveys
   Adapt items as needed for telephone administration and
    California population
     English simplification & cultural adaptation
     Linguistic translation (multiple forward with group reconciliation)
   Pre-testing and interviewer training
   Ongoing, monthly monitoring of live interviews

 Sexual identity & behavior content
   In the first CHIS cycle (CHIS 2001), we asked 2 sexual identity
    questions of adults < age 65
        1. This next question is about your sexual orientation and I
           want to remind you again that your answers are
           completely confidential.
           Are you gay, {lesbian,} or bisexual?
        IF YES
        2. Is that gay {,lesbian} or bisexual?
4

 Evolution of sexual identity & behavior
   During CHIS 2001 administration
     Monitored interviews
     Examined interview break-offs
   Following CHIS 2001, expert consultation with Dr. Susan
    Cochran, UCLA School of Public Health
     Analysis of 2001 data (and later CHIS 2003 data)
     Emphasized need for sexual behavior questions
   LGBT Work Group in preparation of CHIS 2007 & 2009
     Review existing content and recommend changes
     Added new questions on gender of spouses and registered domestic
       partners in 2009
5

 Sexual identity & behavior content
   In 2003, we added 2-3 questions on sexual behavior and one
    on sexual identity
    1. We are asking a few questions about people’s sexual
       experiences. All answers will be kept private.
    In the past 12 months, how many sexual partners have you had?
    IF “DON’T KNOW” ASK:
    2. Can you give me your best guess?
    3. {Is that partner male or female?} In the past 12 months, have
        your partners been male, female, or both male and female?
6

 Sexual identity & behavior content
   Modified the sexual identity question (CHIS 2003 on)
    Do you think of yourself as straight or heterosexual, as gay
    {, lesbian} or homosexual, or bisexual?
   Asked initially (2003) of all adults
   High misclassification of adults over age 70 (bisexual)
   Limited universe to age < 70 in cycles after CHIS 2003

 CHIS sexual identity item non-response
  Item non-response in CHIS is generally low
          Averages about 2 to 3%
          Some items are much higher (Household income is about 23%)
  To assess item non-response, combine “don’t know”
   responses and refusals
10

 CHIS SI item non-response by language
11

 CHIS SI item non-response by language & gender
12

 CHIS sexual identity item non-response
  Sexual identity item non-response in CHIS is low,
   about 2% overall
  Differs by language (Spanish and Cantonese) and language by
   gender among Asians (much higher among females)
  Why?
     Evidence about Spanish (Miller et al.)
     Not clear why the gender difference for Asian language respondents
  Is non-response random?
     Probably (based on patterns of association, cognitive work and “Other”
       specify responses, but more work is needed)
     If not random and non-responders are predominantly sexual minorities,
       it could significantly increase estimates of the LGBT population
13

   Summary Remarks
14

 CHIS sexual identity & behavior
    Important to collect information on sexual identity and
     behavior in EHRs; paucity of data, especially on
     transgender populations
    Feasible to collect accurate info about sexual identity &
     behavior from a diverse, multi-lingual population
    Question wording is important and knowledge base has
     improved a lot in the past decade (NCHS and others)
    More work needed
       On gender identity and expression questions
       Certain language and gender groups and randomness of INR
       Testing of new wording to improve item non-response
15

 CHIS sexual identity & behavior
    Mode of interview (or collection in EHRs) is also very
     important and question wording has to be adapted for
     different modes
    Issues related to mode (ACASI, personal interview, self-
     administration)
        Privacy, discreteness, environment
        Low-literacy populations
        Collection of sensitive information
        Consistent content and administration of questions
        Help for those who need it

 CHIS questionnaire development
  California SB 416 (2011)
     Would have required CHIS and California BRFSS to collect “information
      pertaining to sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender
      expression.”
     Vetoed by Governor Brown
